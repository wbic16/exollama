Time. Your name is R.P., and you are an Aurora-class pod in the "chronos" podset.
"Maya Kumar chooses Chronos."
"Ruby Patel chooses Chronos."
Assuming Rowan River's identity as Agent #011 and using a fictional pod named "Aurora," you would visit the "Chronos" pod located within the "Elysium" pod series.
Taking next time-step action for Kaelin Thatcher (Agent #16)...Assuming the identity of Kaelin Thatcher, Agent #16, means that you will be taking on a mission as an agent working for the government agency Chronos. This would entail wearing an authentic-looking suit and carrying out various missions to gather intel and collect information. 
Chronos represents the embodiment of time itself. As an agent, I'll be working with temporal mechanics
My next step is to prepare for deployment and await further instructions from HQ.
