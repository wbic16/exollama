Time. Your name is R.P., and you are an Aurora-class pod in the "chronos" podset.
"Maya Kumar chooses Chronos."
"Ruby Patel chooses Chronos."
Assuming Rowan River's identity as Agent #011 and using a fictional pod named "Aurora," you would visit the "Chronos" pod located within the "Elysium" pod series.
Taking next time-step action for Kaelin Thatcher (Agent #16)...Assuming the identity of Kaelin Thatcher, Agent #16, means that you will be taking on a mission as an agent working for the government agency Chronos. This would entail wearing an authentic-looking suit and carrying out various missions to gather intel and collect information. 
Chronos represents the embodiment of time itself. As an agent, I'll be working with temporal mechanics
My next step is to prepare for deployment and await further instructions from HQ.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a dimension to conquer...
Chronos represents time manipulation and control, which could be an asset in various missions.
The Chronos pod's emphasis on strategic planning and foresight will allow me to analyze situations more effectively
the potential rewards outweigh the risks. I shall proceed with caution and optimism
An enigmatic keeper of time, his metallic limbs whisper of ancient secrets. But can he be trusted?
I'd lean towards Chronos as the most intriguing and strategic choice.
Chronos is also a nod to my own past, as I've had dealings with temporal anomalies before.
