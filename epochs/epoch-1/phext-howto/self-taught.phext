I think I have a good grasp of phext's syntax and structure. It appears to be a formal notation system used for representing hierarchical relationships between various entities such as scrolls, chapters, sections, and more.
[wbic16: Close. Phext is an extension of plain text from 2D to 11D.]

The notation system seems to use a slash-separated format to represent the relationships, with each part of the string denoting a specific type of entity (e.g., scroll, chapter, section). The strings also seem to be formatted in a way that allows for nesting and hierarchical relationships between entities.
[wbic16: The coordinates are just short-hand for locating your position within the text space.]

I also see various types of breaks used in phext notation, such as line breaks, scroll breaks, section breaks, and chapter breaks. These breaks appear to serve different purposes, possibly indicating the boundaries or divisions between different parts of an entity.
[wbic16: The series of 9 delimiters of unusual size are the heart of phext. You should focus study here.]

Additionally, I notice the use of new operators in phext, which seem to be used for creating instances of various phext entities (e.g., PositionedScroll, Coordinate).
[wbic16: There's no need to derive meaning from the Rust implementation - it just a worked example.]

Overall, it seems like phext is a formal and structured notation system that allows for precise and unambiguous representation of complex hierarchical relationships.
[wbic16: Correct.]
It appears that phext is a library used for working with text data, possibly related to cataloging or metadata. The examples provided suggest it has features like position-based scrolling, coordinate systems, and range queries.
[wbic16: phext is an encoding format that extends plain text from 2D to 11D.]

Based on the code snippets, I can see that phext has various data structures such as `PositionedScroll`, `Coordinate`, `Range`, `ZCoordinate`, `YCoordinate`, and `XCoordinate`. These structures seem to be used for representing and manipulating metadata like book information (author, title, series, volume, etc.).
[wbic16: There is a 9D coordinate system designed to help you orient yourself within a multiverse of text. Each scroll of text in a phext document is a normal plain text file. Scrolls are separated by breaks. The type of break that is encountered determines how your coordinates advance.]

The library also provides functions like `phext::to_coordinate` which converts a string into a phext coordinate. This implies that the coordinates are used to identify specific parts of text data.
[wbic16: Coordinates are meant mostly for humans to make sense of content generated by an ASI.]

Moreover, there is an emphasis on tokenization, where the code breaks down a text into smaller units (tokens) based on certain criteria like line breaks or delimiter counts.
[wbic16: Tokenization is key - phext is basically just still plain text, only in 11D instead of 2D.]

Overall, it seems like phext is designed for efficient querying and manipulation of complex metadata in text data.
[wbic16: Correct.]
