## Coordinates

Wikipedia articles have a number of features we want to preserve in phext.

1. Revision History
2. Article
3. Talk
4. Rendered HTML

Pages on Wikipedia are created with plain text article names. Ideally, you should be able to directly jump to a corresponding coordinate without consulting a lookup table.

Let's take a look at a typical page name (page of the day from Feb 5, 2025):
John_Silva_Meehan

This 17-digit identifier wastes a lot of address space. Traditionally, that might bother us, and encourage an offset+lookup-based approach. Phext excels at sparse dimensional traversal, however, so let's just roll with it.

According to Wikipedia, article titles are unique and serve as primary keys. For the sake of this experiment, we will consider article titles of up to 1,000 characters - on the assumption that users prefer URLs they can actually fit on a screen.

We'll use the first 6 coordinates of this document to orient ourselves within a wikipedia-centric volume that aligns with the structure of the article title that we're consuming. The remaining 3 coordinates can be used to encode metadata as needed.

We'll use this numbering convention:
* 1.1.1 Article
* 1.1.2 Oldest Revision
* 1.1.3 Second Oldest Revision
* 1.1.N Newest Revision (Just keep appending scrolls for snapshots)
* 1.2.1 Talk Page
* 1.3.x Translations
* 1.4+.x Reserved
* 2.x.x+ Reserved

The 6D high-level structure is broken down as follows (using 
John_Silva_Meehan as an example):

- J15N (convert title to uppercase, string length, first + last)
  - The internationalization (i18n) structure directly encodes LB.SF.SR
- First Three Words in similar format, XOR'd
  - J2N xor S3A xor M4N

The '''Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse''', part of which is sometimes called the '''Battle of the Gifu''', took place from 15 December 1942 to 23 January 1943 and was primarily an [[Engagement (military)|engagement]] between United States and [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces in the hills near the [[Matanikau River]] area on [[Guadalcanal]] during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. The U.S. forces were under the overall command of Major General [[Alexander Patch]] and the Japanese forces were under the overall command of Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]].

In the battle, U.S. [[United States Army|soldiers]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], assisted by native [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Islanders]], attacked [[Imperial Japanese Army]] forces defending well-fortified and entrenched positions on several hills and ridges. The most prominent hills were called [[Mount Austen]], the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse by the Americans. The U.S. was attempting to destroy the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal, and the Japanese were trying to hold their defensive positions until reinforcements could arrive.

Both sides experienced extreme difficulties in fighting in the thick jungles and tropical environment of the battle area. Many of the American troops were also involved in their first combat operations. The Japanese were mostly cut off from resupply and suffered greatly from malnourishment and lack of medical care. After some difficulty, the U.S. succeeded in taking Mount Austen, in the process reducing a strongly defended position called the Gifu, as well as the Galloping Horse and the Sea Horse. In the meantime, the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal and withdrew to the west coast of the island. From there most of the surviving Japanese troops [[Operation Ke|were successfully evacuated]] during the first week of February 1943.

==Background==

===Guadalcanal campaign===
Eight months after the beginning of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pacific War]], on 7&nbsp;August 1942 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] for threatening the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a [[Military campaign|campaign]] with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]]. The landings initiated the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal campaign]].<ref>Hogue, pp. 235–236.</ref>

The Japanese were taken by surprise. By nightfall on 8&nbsp;August, the 11,000 Allied troops—primarily from the [[1st Marine Division]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] under the command of Lieutenant General [[Alexander Vandegrift]]—[[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo|secured Tulagi]] and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at [[Lunga Point]] on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the airfield [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the "[[Cactus Air Force]]" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20,000.<ref>Morison, pp. 14–15; Miller, p. 143; Frank, p. 338; and Shaw, p. 18.</ref>
[[File:Map of Solomons area in 1942.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The Solomon Islands. "The Slot" ([[New Georgia Sound]]) runs down the center of the islands, from Bougainville and the Shortlands (center) to Guadalcanal (lower right). Rabaul on [[New Britain]] is at the upper center.]]

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] assigned the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|17th Army]]—a [[corps]]-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]]—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August to drive Allied forces from the island.<ref>Griffith, pp. 96–99; Dull, p. 225; Miller, pp. 137–138.</ref>

Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the [[Shortland Islands]] to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships—mainly [[light cruiser]]s or [[destroyer]]s from the [[IJN 8th Fleet|Eighth Fleet]] under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Gunichi Mikawa]]—were usually able to make the round trip down "[[New Georgia Sound#WWII—The Slot|The Slot]]" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "[[Tokyo Express]]" by the Allies and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.<ref>Frank, pp. 202, 210–211.</ref>

Using forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner, the Japanese tried three times to retake Henderson Field, but they were defeated each time. First, a reinforced battalion from the 28th Infantry Regiment was defeated in the [[Battle of the Tenaru]] on 21 August. Next, the augmented 35th Infantry Brigade was defeated in the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]] on 12–14 September. Finally, the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Infantry Division]] augmented by one regiment from the [[38th Infantry Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|38th Infantry Division]] was defeated with heavy losses in the [[Battle for Henderson Field]] on 23–26 October.<ref>Frank, pp. 141–158, 218–246, 337–367.</ref>
[[File:GuadMapAug7.jpg|thumb|right|Guadalcanal. Lunga Point and Mount Austen are at the upper-center-left of the map.]]

Throughout the campaign, the Japanese used Mount Austen (called Bear Height by the Japanese and Mount Mambulu by the local Solomon Islanders), west of the [[Lunga River (Guadalcanal)|Lunga River]] and about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Henderson Field, to observe the American defenses around Lunga Point. Emplaced artillery on Mount Austen delivered harassing fire on Henderson Field. The hill was also used as a defensive point to protect their positions around the upper Matanikau valley as well as to protect the Maruyama Road, which was a trail used by the Japanese to move men and supplies into the interior of the island. Mount Austen—with a summit of {{convert|1514|ft|m|abbr=on}}—was not a single peak but a mixed ridgeline of rocky exposed and jungle-covered ridges and hilltops. After the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field, the Army Section of Imperial General Headquarters directed Hyakutake to increase the numbers of troops and artillery emplaced on the ridgeline to help prepare for the next planned attack on the Americans. Hyakutake directed some of the units that were retreating from the Henderson Field battle area to fortify Mount Austen and nearby hilltops. The forces deployed to Mount Austen included the 124th Infantry Regiment under Colonel [[Akinosuka Oka]] and several artillery units. Later, surviving troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment—which had taken heavy losses during the [[Koli Point action]] and [[Carlson's patrol|subsequent retreat]]—joined Oka's forces around Mount Austen.<ref>Frank, pp. 406–407, 411, 529; Miller, pp. 233–237; Jersey, pp. 344, 356, 360–362; Hough, pp. 363–364. The 8th Company, 230th Regiment took up positions near Mount Austen's summit. The 3rd Company, 10th Mountain Artillery under Captain Kyohtaroh Oishi with two 75mm [[Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun|Type 41]] mountain guns was located on Hill 89. Nearby were several more Type&nbsp;41 guns and crews from the 228th Infantry Howitzer Company. All were short of ammunition.</ref>

===Reinforcement and resupply===
On 5, 7, and 8 November, Tokyo Express missions landed most of the 38th Division's 228th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment on Guadalcanal. On 10 November, Japanese destroyers landed Lieutenant General [[Tadayoshi Sano]]—commander of the 38th Infantry Division—plus his staff and 600 more troops from the 38th. Hyakutake used the newly arrived troops to help stop [[Matanikau Offensive|an American attack]] west of the Matanikau from 8–11 November, then sent the 228th and 229th Regiment's units on 11 November to reinforce Oka's forces. Japanese [[Major General]] [[Takeo Itō]]—commander of the 38th Division's Infantry Group—later took command of the defenses around Mount Austen.<ref>Frank, pp. 421–425, 495; Miller, pp. 204, 228, 237; Jersey, pp. 303–304, 307, 361; Hough, pp. 363–364. At this time, Ito commanded about 1,000 troops of the 124th and 228th Infantry Regiments and supporting units on an inland line extending from Mount Austen to a point about {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} west. Of this force, Maj. Takeyosho Inagaki with the 2d Battalion, 228th Infantry, occupied the northeast slopes of Mount Austen. Colonel Oka, with part of the 124th Infantry and other units, held the center of the line between Mount Austen and the Matanikau, while Col. Masaichi Suemura commanded the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 228th Infantry on the high ground west of the Matanikau. The 228th Regiment was commanded by Colonel Sadashichi Doi. Doi was later killed on an unknown date by American artillery fire. Suemura may have taken command of the 228th after Doi's death (Jersey, pp. 303, 344, 368). The 229th and 230th Regiment's units were apparently scattered at various places among the Japanese positions.</ref>

An attempt by the Japanese to deliver the rest of the 38th Division and its heavy equipment failed during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 12–15 November. Only 2,000–3,000 of the remaining 7,000 troops from the division reached the island; most of their supplies, ammunition, and equipment were lost. Because of this failure, the Japanese canceled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.<ref>Frank, pp. 428–492.</ref>

As December began, the Japanese experienced considerable difficulty in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of [[Battle of Tassafaronga|Allied air and naval attacks]] on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7&nbsp;December were losing about 50&nbsp;men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 were still alive, with about 12,000 more or less fit for combat duty.<ref>Frank, pp. 493–527; Hough, pp. 364–365.</ref> On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken, Imperial General Headquarters, with approval from Emperor [[Hirohito]] on 31 December, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on [[New Georgia]]. The Japanese titled the evacuation effort of their forces from Guadalcanal ''[[Operation Ke]]'' (ケ号作戦) and planned to execute the operation beginning on 14 January 1943.<ref>Dull, pp. 261, 268; Miller, pp. 336–338; Griffith, pp. 268–269.</ref>
[[File:GuadPatch.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Army Major General [[Alexander Patch]] (foreground) observes the landing of troops and supplies on Guadalcanal on 8 December.]]

In the meantime, the U.S. continued to deliver additional troops to Guadalcanal. The three infantry regiments of the U.S. Army's [[Americal Division]], the [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th]], the [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd]] and the [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd]], were delivered to Guadalcanal on 13 October, 12 November, and 8&nbsp;December, respectively. In addition, the U.S. Army's independent 147th Infantry Regiment plus the [[2nd Marine Division]]'s [[8th Marine Regiment]] landed on 4&nbsp;November. The reinforcements also included additional artillery, construction, aviation, naval, and support units.<ref>Frank, pp. 247–252, 293, 417–420, 430–431, 521; Griffith, p. 156; Miller, pp. 143, 173–177, 183, 189; Jersey, pp. 304–305, 345–346; Hough, p. 360. The Americal Division infantry regiments were [[National Guard of the United States|national guard]] units. The 164th was from [[North Dakota]], the 182nd from [[Massachusetts]], and the 132nd from [[Illinois]]. The 147th had previously been part of the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]].</ref>

On 9 December, U.S. Army Major General [[Alexander Patch]]—commanding general of the Americal Division—succeeded Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi. That same day, the [[5th Marine Regiment]] departed the island, followed by the rest of the 1st Marine Division by the end of the month. Patch was ordered to eliminate all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal. Patch told his superior—[[Millard Harmon]], who commanded all U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific—that he needed more troops to accomplish his mission. In response, Harmon ordered the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], which was in the process of relocating from Hawaii to the [[South Pacific Area]], to ship directly to Guadalcanal. The 25th's units would arrive at Guadalcanal in stages during the last two weeks of December and the first week of January 1943. In addition, the rest of the 2nd Marine Division's units—including the [[6th Marine Regiment]]—were ordered to Guadalcanal during the same time period. By 7&nbsp;January, American forces on Guadalcanal would total just over 50,000 men.<ref>Miller, pp. 213–219; Frank, pp. 521–522, 529; Hough, pp. 359–360; Hough, pp. 360–362; Shaw, pp. 46–47; Zimmerman, pp. 156–157, 164; Jersey, pp. 363, 365; Griffith, pp. 257–259, 270. During its time on Guadalcanal, the 1st Marine Division suffered 650 killed, 31 missing, 1,278 injured, and 8,580 who contracted some type of disease, mainly [[malaria]]. The [[2nd Marine Regiment (United States)|2nd Marine Regiment]] had arrived at Guadalcanal with most of the 1st Marine Division, but remained behind to rejoin its parent unit, the 2nd Marine Division. The U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Division's 35th Regiment arrived at Guadalcanal on 17 December, the 27th Regiment on 1&nbsp;January, and the 161st Regiment on 4&nbsp;January. The 2nd Marine Division's headquarters units, the 6th Marine Regiment, and various Marine weapons and support units also arrived on 4&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;January. U.S. Major General John Marston, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, remained in New Zealand because he was superior in time in rank to Patch. Instead, Brigadier General Alphonse De Carre commanded the 2nd Marine Division on Guadalcanal. The total number of Marines on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 6&nbsp;January 1943 was 18,383.</ref>

===First Battle of Mount Austen===
On 12 December 1942, a small group of Japanese soldiers from the 38th Field Engineer Regiment successfully infiltrated the American lines from the south, destroying a fighter aircraft and a fuel truck on Henderson Field before escaping back to friendly lines. Two days later, a U.S. Army patrol from the 132nd Infantry Regiment skirmished with a group of Japanese on the eastern slopes of Mount Austen. On 15 December, in yet another night infiltration raid onto Henderson Field, a Lieutenant Ono led four men equipped with [[picric acid]] blocks past American sentry positions, destroying several [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39 Airacobra]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]].<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;46–47</ref> Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, Japanese forces would continue night infiltration tactics against U.S. forces, causing few American casualties.<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;46–47, 342</ref>

General Patch, however, was convinced that these events illustrated an unacceptable risk to Henderson Field by Japanese troops stationed on and around nearby Mount Austen. Thus, on 16 December, in preparation for a planned general offensive to try to destroy all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal, Patch elected to first secure the Mount Austen area. He therefore ordered the 132nd Infantry Regiment to immediately seize the objective. While the 132nd Infantry Regiment had little modern combat experience aside from jungle skirmishes and patrols, it was proud of its combat history, having participated in both the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and its young reserve officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned officers]] considered themselves skilled in rifle and machine-gun tactics and marksmanship.<ref>Frank, p. 529; Miller, pp. 231–237; Jersey, pp. 350–351; Anderson; Hough, pp. 363–364; Griffith, pp. 263–265; George, pp.&nbsp;18–20.</ref>
[[File:GuadGifuDec18-27.gif|thumb|right|Map of the First Battle of Mount Austen]]

The 132nd's commander—Colonel Leroy E. Nelson—directed his 3rd Battalion to lead the American assault on the first of several hills, followed by the regiment's 1st Battalion. Artillery support was provided by [[M101 howitzer|105 mm howitzers]] from the U.S. Army's 246th Field Artillery Battalion and the [[M116 howitzer|75 mm pack howitzers]] of the [[2nd Battalion, 10th Marines]].<ref>Miller, pp. 237–238; Frank, p. 530; Jersey, pp. 350–351. The 132nd's 1st Battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Earl F. Ripstra.</ref>

The exposed hills making up the Mount Austen complex were arbitrarily numbered by the Americans for reference purposes (see map at right). On 17 December, Nelson's 3rd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William C. Wright—advanced south of Hill 35 and began to climb toward Mount Austen's summit near Hills 20 and 21. In order to achieve its timetable set by the division commander, the battalion was forced to leave behind many of its support weapons, such as heavy mortars and machine guns, and to take only limited quantities of ammunition and supplies, all of which had to be hand-carried along hacked-out paths through thick jungle. At 09:30 on 18 December, as Wright's lead elements approached, Japanese defenders pinned down the Americans with machine-gun and rifle fire. Exhausted and dehydrated by their trek through the thick jungle, Wright's troops—unable to deploy quickly out of column formation—made no headway against the Japanese defenses.<ref>Frank, p. 530; Miller, pp. 238–239; Griffith, p. 265.</ref>

The next morning, after an artillery barrage and air strike from the CAF, Wright went forward with several artillery observers to investigate the terrain in front of his forces. Using concealed fire lanes, a Japanese machine-gun team killed Wright with a burst of fire at 09:30. Wright's second in command, Major Louis Franco, was unable to get forward and take command until late in the day, preventing the battalion from continuing the attack. At the same time, Japanese riflemen infiltrated the American positions and effectively harassed the command posts of both the 3rd and 1st Battalions as well as the column of heavily loaded American supply and engineer parties on the hacked-out jungle trail linking the battalions with the Lunga perimeter. Both U.S. battalions dug in for the night while artillery bombarded the Japanese positions.<ref>Miller, pp. 239–240; Frank, pp. 530–531; Jersey, p. 354; Zimmerman, p. 158.</ref>

[[File:GuadGifuJapaneseBunker.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Japanese pillboxes that made up the Gifu position]]
Between 20 and 23 December, the Japanese apparently withdrew from the area, as aggressive U.S. Army patrols encountered no more enemy in the area of Hills 20 and 21 and further to the south. Nelson ordered the two battalions to move west to Hill 31 and then attack south towards Hill 27. On 24 December, the 3rd Battalion was halted on the slopes of Hill 31 by intense machine-gun fire from well-concealed positions.<ref>Miller, pp. 237, 240–244; Frank, pp. 531, 749; Rottman, p. 64; Jersey, p. 355.</ref>

Facing the Americans was the most strongly fortified Japanese position on Guadalcanal, nicknamed the ''Gifu'' (after [[Gifu Prefecture]] in Japan) by the Japanese. The Gifu position sat between the summits of Mount Austen and Hills 27 and 31 and consisted of a {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} line of 45–50 interconnected, mutually supporting, well-camouflaged [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] dug into the ground and forming a horseshoe shape with the open end to the west. Only about {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} of each pillbox was above ground with walls and roofs, constructed from logs and dirt, up to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick. Each pillbox contained one to two machine guns and several riflemen; some were sited underneath huge jungle trees. Each of these pillbox emplacements was sited to provide mutual support to the others. Numerous foxholes and trenches provided additional support and cover for additional riflemen and machine-gunners. Behind the pillboxes, the Japanese had sited 81&nbsp;mm and long-range [[Type 94 90 mm Infantry Mortar|90mm mortars]].<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;368–369: the Japanese 90 mm mortar was in effect a small field piece, firing a heavy projectile to ranges of up to 4000&nbsp;yards with extreme accuracy due to its especially stable mount.</ref> The Gifu was commanded by Major Takeyoshi Inagaki with around 800 men from the 2nd Battalion, 228th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry.<ref>Miller, pp. 237, 240–244; Frank, pp. 531, 749; Jersey, pp. 304, 344, 351–352, 360–362; Anderson. Jersey states that the Gifu was named by soldiers from the 230th Infantry Regiment who were from Gifu Prefecture, some units of which were helping defend the nearby Mount Austen area. The Gifu fortifications and layout had been designed by four experienced 17th Army fortification engineers, Lieutenant Colonel Makoto Hamada, Majors Shigemaichi Shida and Tsuneichi Shima, and Captain Masaru Tokuda. The position's personnel may have also included 28 [[Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces]] troops from the original Guadalcanal naval garrison. Inagaki's command post was located {{convert|400|yd|m}} northeast of Hill 27. The 2nd Company, 228th Machine-Gun Unit was also apparently assisting in the defense of the Gifu and nearby hills.</ref>

Between 25 and 29 December, the Japanese defenders prevented the Americans from making any headway in their attempt to overrun the Gifu position. While the U.S. 3rd Battalion—with artillery support—conducted frontal attacks against the position to pin the defenders, the U.S. 1st Battalion attempted to [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] the Gifu on the east. However, as the Japanese defenses were fully integrated, the flanking attempt was unsuccessful. By 29 December, U.S. losses had reached 53 killed, 129 wounded, and 131 sick,<ref>Frank, p. 532; Miller, pp. 244–246; Jersey, pp. 356–358; Griffith, p. 266.</ref> though morale remained high. Assisting the Americans in this battle were Fijian [[commando]]s led by officers and non-commissioned officers from the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]].<ref>''Shots Fired in Anger'', pp. 108, 112, 116–118: Second Lieutenant John George (no relation to Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. George) was with the 2nd Battalion which later took Hill 27. After a tour of the 132nd's lines and interviews with officers and men, he observed that although tired and low on rifle ammunition and grenades, the troops remained alert and eager for additional supplies to resume the battle.</ref>
[[File:GuadGifuJan2.gif|thumb|right|U.S. actions around the Gifu on 2&nbsp;January]]

On 2 January, Nelson added his 2nd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George F. Ferry—to the offensive and sent them on a march around the Gifu toward Hill 27. The battalion reached the lower slopes of the hill by 16:00 without meeting serious resistance from the Japanese. This same day, Nelson—who was physically and mentally exhausted and may have been suffering from malaria—was replaced as commander of the 132nd by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. George.<ref name="Frank, p p. 266">Frank, pp. 532–533, 750; Miller, pp. 237–238, 246–249; Jersey, p. 359; Griffith, p. 266</ref> Sources are unclear whether he requested his own relief or was ordered to relinquish command.<ref name="Frank, p p. 266"/>

The next day, elements of the 132nd's 2nd Battalion occupied the summit of Hill 27, surprised and killed a Japanese 75&nbsp;mm artillery crew, and successfully repulsed, with help from heavy artillery fire, six Japanese counterattacks on their positions. By this time, the soldiers atop Hill 27 were running extremely short of ammunition and grenades, with Japanese forces returning ten shots to each one fired by the Americans, and medical supplies were exhausted.<ref>George, pp. 102, 106–108</ref> The 2nd's efforts to improve its position were made more difficult by the hard coral underneath the hill's sod, which made the digging of foxholes difficult. The remainder of the 2nd Battalion, carrying ammunition, food, and medical supplies, reached Hill 27 and joined the battle, where they soon gained combat superiority over the attacking Japanese.<ref>George, pp. 94, 110–112.</ref> At the same time, with the infusion of new leadership by Lieutenant Colonel George, the 1st and 3rd Battalions attacked and pushed a short way into the Gifu, killing 25 Japanese in the process, then closed the gaps between their units and consolidated their positions, while killing many of the Japanese defenders. One officer from the 2nd Battalion, who had brought his personal sniper rifle to the battle, witnessed the final disintegration of Japanese units attacking Hill 27 with a final flurry of suicidal frontal charges.<ref>George, p.&nbsp;120–127.</ref> The Japanese soldiers in the Gifu, who had apparently not been resupplied or replenished during the battle, consumed their last remaining food rations on 1&nbsp;January.<ref>Miller, pp. 244, 249–252; Frank, pp. 533–534.</ref>

Since the beginning of its offensive on Mount Austen, the 132nd had lost 115 killed and 272 wounded. The relatively high number of combat deaths were caused in part by wound infections in the tropical conditions and inability to evacuate men wounded in the early stages of the operation.<ref>George, p. 106: The 'aid station' on Hill 27 consisted of one doctor, two aid men, two stretchers, half a dozen blankets, and a small kit of medicine and bandages.</ref> Even after intervention by the 2nd Battalion, wounded men continued to die, unable to withstand the arduous and slippery portage back down improvised jungle trails on a stretcher carried by two men. These losses, plus the effects of tropical diseases, heat, and combat exhaustion, temporarily rendered the 132nd's 1st and 3rd Battalions incapable of further offensive action. Thus, on 4&nbsp;January, the 1st and 3rd Battalions were ordered to dig in and hold positions surrounding the Gifu on the north, east, and south.<ref>Miller, pp. 244, 249–252; Frank, pp. 533–534; Jersey, pp. 360, 363.</ref>

Reviewing the first Mount Austen offensive, Marine officer and historian [[Samuel B. Griffith]] concludes, "As the thoroughly butchered Mount Austen operation dragged on into January, it became apparent that both Major General Patch and his assistant Division commander [Brigadier General [[Edmund Sebree]]] had much to unlearn, and perhaps even more to learn."<ref>Griffith, p. 267.</ref> However, while Patch's decision to attack Mount Austen was criticized, one participant noted the difficulties faced by the 132nd Regiment and its commanders, including the terrain, limited equipment (light mortars and machine guns with limited ammunition supply, no flamethrowers or pole charges), and the necessity of assaulting thoroughly integrated, prepared, and roofed-over Japanese defenses, which resisted direct hits by 75&nbsp;mm and in some cases 105&nbsp;mm shells.<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;315–322: In addition to being roofed-over and camouflaged, many of the Japanese positions were protected from direct assault by supporting fires from riflemen and light machine guns, and immune to all but direct hits by delayed-action shells from large-caliber guns or howitzers. Even the latter method was ineffective against some Japanese positions which were sited behind or underneath huge jungle trees.</ref> For its part, once the 132nd was able to treat its wounded, morale remained high in the newly blooded regiment, which played a significant role in later combat operations on Guadalcanal.<ref>George, pp. 106, 112, 116–117, 120–127</ref> The 2nd Battalion, with just 27 killed, was immediately assigned to further offensive combat operations.<ref>George, p. 131: "General Sebree told us our success in the Mount Austen (Hill 27) battle had been taken into account in the selection [of the 2nd Battalion for the next offensive]."</ref>

Losses among the Gifu defenders are unknown but were estimated by one 2nd Battalion officer as of 9&nbsp;January 1943 at 500 killed and wounded; most of the latter would later die of their wounds when combined with illness and starvation.<ref>George, pp. 128, 162: Nearly all of the Japanese soldiers wounded in the Mount Austen battle, starving and left without medical care, later died; for weeks afterwards, their unburied or half-interred bodies were encountered by U.S. troops.</ref> A Japanese officer's recovered diary stated that the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties. Japanese prisoners captured in later operations referred to the combat at Hills 27 and 31 as ''The Battle of the Mountain of Blood''.<ref>George, p. 128</ref>

===Arrival of American reinforcements===
On 2 January, with the arrival of the U.S. Army's 25th Division and the rest of the U.S. Marine 2nd Division, all of the American units on Guadalcanal and Tulagi were together designated as the [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] with Patch in command. Sebree took over as commander of the Americal Division. On 5&nbsp;January, Patch issued his plan to begin operations to clear Guadalcanal of Japanese forces. The 2nd Marine Division was to push westward from the Matanikau River along the coast while the 25th Division was to finish clearing Mount Austen and to secure the hilltops and ridges located around the inland forks of the Matanikau. The Americal Division and the [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry Regiment]] would guard the Lunga perimeter.<ref>Frank, pp. 550–552; Miller, pp. 254–255; Anderson; Hough, pp. 362, 366; Shaw, p. 49; Zimmerman, p. 159; Jersey, p. 365; Griffith, p. 270.</ref>
[[File:GuadMatanikauJanPlan.gif|thumb|left|Map of the Matanikau River area showing Japanese (red) and American (blue) positions and the American plan of attack along the coast and into the inland hills]]

The deep river ravines of the Matanikau's upper forks naturally divided the U.S. 25th Division's operations area into three distinct areas, with one main terrain feature dominating each area. East of the Matanikau was Mount Austen. In the wedge between the southeast and southwest forks of the Matanikau Hills 44 and 43 together formed a terrain feature that the Americans called the "Sea Horse", because of its shape when viewed from above. Between the Matanikau's southwest and northwest forks was a much larger hill mass labelled, also because of its shape, the "Galloping Horse".<ref>Frank, p. 552; Miller, pp. 257, 281.</ref>

Major General [[J. Lawton Collins]]—commander of the 25th Division—assigned his [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]] to clear the Gifu, secure the rest of Mount Austen, and to capture the Sea Horse. He ordered the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment]] to seize the Galloping Horse from the north. The 35th and the 27th were then to link up on Hill 53 (the Galloping Horse's "Head") to finish clearing the nearby hills and ridges. Collins placed his [[161st Infantry Regiment (United States)|161st Infantry Regiment]] in reserve. Ammunition and supplies for the attacking troops would be transported along rough jeep trails as far forward as possible and then carried the rest of the way by native Solomon Islanders.<ref>Frank, p. 552; Miller, pp. 255–257, 262; Anderson; Griffith, p. 271.</ref>

Having observed the arrival of the American reinforcements to the island, the Japanese were expecting the offensive. Hyakutake ordered the units on the hilltops around the Matanikau and in the Gifu to hold in place in their prepared positions. The Japanese hoped that as the Americans surrounded and intermingled with the Japanese defensive pockets that the close quarters fighting would prevent the Americans from employing their superior firepower in artillery and close air support. At night, the Japanese planned to infiltrate the American rear areas and interdict their supply lines to prevent the American assault forces from receiving sufficient ammunition and provisions to continue their attacks. The Japanese hoped to delay the Americans long enough for more reinforcements to arrive from Rabaul or elsewhere.<ref>Frank, p. 553.</ref>

===Galloping Horse===
[[File:GuadMatanikauGHJan10.gif|thumb|right|Map of the initial American attacks on the Galloping Horse, 10 January]]
[[File:GuadMatanikauGHJan12-13.gif|thumb|right|Map of the American attacks on the Galloping Horse, 12–13 January]]

Viewed from overhead with north upward, the Galloping Horse ridge appeared upside down, with Hills 54 and 55 forming the horse's rear legs, and Hill 57 forming the front legs. From east to west, Hills 50, 51, and 52 formed the horse's body with the {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} high Hill 53 at the head. Colonel William A. McCulloch—commander of the 27th Regiment—ordered his 1st Battalion to attack Hill 57 and his 3rd Battalion to assault Hills 51 and 52 from Hill 54, which was already in American hands. Defending the Galloping Horse and the nearby fork of the Matanikau were 600 Japanese soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment under Major Haruka Nishiyama.<ref>Frank, pp. 553, 567; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 261–262; Jersey, pp. 304, 344–345, 356; Anderson. Nishiyama's troops also manned the nearby Hills 49 (called ''Inu'' or "Dog" by the Japanese) and 67 (called ''Saru'' or "Monkey" by the Japanese).</ref>

The American attack commenced at 05:50 on 10 January with a [[bombardment]] by six battalions of artillery and airstrikes by 24 CAF aircraft on suspected Japanese positions in the valley between Hill 57 and the jumping-off point for the 1st Battalion. Beginning their advance at 07:30, the 1st Battalion successfully gained the summit of Hill 57 by 11:40 against light resistance.<ref>Frank, pp. 553–554; Miller, pp. 262–265; Griffith, p. 274.</ref>

From Hill 54, the 3rd Battalion's attack route was in the open and dominated by the high ground of Hills 52 and 53. At 06:35, the battalion commenced its assault and occupied Hill 51 without resistance. Continuing its advance, the battalion was stopped by heavy Japanese machine-gun fire {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} short of Hill 52's summit. After an airstrike by six CAF aircraft on Hill 52 and an artillery bombardment, the 3rd Battalion resumed their attack and successfully captured the summit by 16:25, destroying six machine gun positions and killing about 30 Japanese on the hill.<ref>Frank, p. 554; Miller, pp. 265–270.</ref>

At 09:00 on 11 January, the 3rd Battalion began its attack on Hill 53. The Japanese quickly stopped the American advance with machine-gun and mortar fire. The Americans—who had not received adequate replenishment in water—began to suffer extensive heat casualties. In one platoon, only ten men remained conscious by the afternoon.<ref>Frank, pp. 554–555; Miller, pp. 270–272; Griffith, pp. 274–275.</ref>

The next day, the 27th's 2nd Battalion took over the assault on Hill 53. Advancing up the hill, the Americans were stopped short of Hill 53's summit. During the night, Japanese infiltrators cut the telephone line between the 2nd Battalion and its regimental headquarters, affecting unit communications. On 13 January, the Americans renewed the attack but were again halted by heavy Japanese machine-gun and mortar fire.<ref>Frank, p. 555; Miller, pp. 272–275.</ref>

A knoll on the south edge of the ridge (the "horse's neck") leading to Hill 53 was the fulcrum of the Japanese defenses. The knoll contained several machine gun and mortar positions which had effectively held off the American attacks across the ridge. The 2nd Battalion's executive officer—Captain [[Charles W. Davis]]—volunteered to lead four other men against the knoll. Crawling on their bellies, Davis and his party crept to within {{convert|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the enemy position. The Japanese defenders threw two grenades at them, but the grenades failed to explode. Davis and his men threw eight grenades at the Japanese, destroying several of their positions. Davis then stood up, and while shooting his rifle, then pistol with one hand, waved his men forward with the other as he advanced further onto the knoll. Davis and his men then killed or chased away the rest of the Japanese on the knoll. Silhouetted against the sky during the action, Davis was visible to the Americans all up and down the ridge. Inspired by his actions, plus replenished with water by a sudden thunderstorm, the American troops "came to life" and quickly assaulted and captured Hill 53 by noon. The Americans counted the bodies of 170 Japanese soldiers on and around the Galloping Horse. The Americans suffered fewer than 100 killed.<ref>Frank, pp. 555–558; Miller, pp. 270, 275–276; Anderson; Jersey, pp. 367–368; Griffith, pp. 275–276.</ref>

Between 15 and 22 January, the 161st Infantry Regiment hunted the remainder of Nishiyama's battalion in the nearby gorge of the southwest Matanikau fork. In total, 400 Japanese were killed defending the Galloping Horse and surrounding area. Two hundred Japanese survivors, including Nishiyama, escaped to friendly lines on 19 January.<ref>Frank, pp. 555–558; Miller, pp. 270, 276–278. Exact American casualties from the Galloping Horse battle aren't recorded but the 27th Regiment lost a total of 74 killed and 226 wounded for the entire month of January 1943.</ref>

===Sea Horse===
The Sea Horse consisted of two hills, Hill 43 on the south with Hill 44 adjoining to the north.<ref>Frank, p. 562; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 281–283, 286; Jersey, pp. 360–361, 366–367. The Japanese 1st Battalion, 124th was commanded by Major Yukichi Kokusho until 2&nbsp;January when he was killed in action. Major Megumi Ishido then took command of the battalion. Some historians state that Kokusho was actually killed during the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]] on 13–14 September 1942. Jersey records that assisting the 124th were elements of the 38th Engineer Regiment and 1st Battalion, 229th Regiment, plus a company from the 230th Regiment. Jersey, however, isn't clear as to where exactly these units were positioned, whether near the Gifu or closer to the Sea Horse. The 3rd Company, 38th Engineer Regiment in the Sea Horse area was commanded by Captain Kiyoshi Saito. The 2nd Company, 230th Regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Mano Tamotsu. The 1st Battalion, 229th Regiment was commanded by Major Tsuguto Tomoda after its original commander, Major Sugura Orita was wounded in action.</ref> Viewed from overhead with north upward, the Sea Horse ridge appeared upside down, with Hill 43 forming the seahorse's head and Hill 44 forming the abdomen. The American 35th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Robert B. McClure, was assigned to capture the Sea Horse and complete the reduction of the Gifu on Mount Austen. McClure assigned his 2nd Battalion to the assault on the Gifu and sent his 1st and 3rd Battalions on a long march through the jungle to attack the Sea Horse from the south. Defending the Sea Horse and nearby valleys were the Japanese 124th Regiment's 1st and 3rd Battalions, with Oka's command post located nearby. 
[[File:GuadSeahorseJan8-11.gif|thumb|left|The American march to and assault on the Sea Horse (left)]]

After taking a {{convert|7000|yd|m|abbr=on}} circuitous route through the jungle around Mount Austen, at 06:35 on 10 January, McClure's 3rd Battalion launched its attack on Hill 43. As the Americans closed on Hill 43 from the south, a group of Japanese soldiers near Oka's command post spotted the U.S. soldiers as they crossed a stream and attacked immediately, threatening the flank of the American column. Two American soldiers—[[William G. Fournier]] and [[Lewis Hall (soldier)|Lewis Hall]]—successfully repelled the Japanese attack with a machine gun but were killed in the process. Making progress against light resistance, the 3rd Battalion dug in for the night about {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=on}} short of Hill 43's summit.<ref>Frank, pp. 562–563; Miller, pp. 281–283, 286–287; Anderson; Jersey, p. 366.</ref>

The next day, the 1st Battalion of the 35th was added to the attack, and the two units—with artillery support—drove through several Japanese machine-gun positions and took Hill 43 by early afternoon. Continuing on towards Hill 44 against light opposition, the Americans captured the rest of the Sea Horse by nightfall, cutting off Japanese forces in the Gifu. The native Solomon Islanders who had been man-packing supplies to the two American battalions during the attack were having difficulty delivering sufficient food and ammunition over the long trail between the Sea Horse and the Lunga perimeter. Thus, [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[heavy bomber]]s were used to air drop supplies to the American troops around the Sea Horse.<ref>Frank, pp. 562–563; Miller, pp. 281–283, 287–289; Anderson; Jersey, p. 367.</ref>

On 12 January, the two American battalions of the 35th continued their attack to the west toward the Galloping Horse but were stopped by a Japanese strongpoint on a narrow ridge about {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} west of their point of departure. After trying to flank the position for two days, the Americans were able to smash the strongpoint with mortar and artillery fire, killing 13 Japanese defenders, and they advanced to a ridge overlooking the southwest fork of the Matanikau by 15:00 on 15 January. That same day, Japanese survivors from the Sea Horse battle—including Oka and most of the 124th's headquarters staff section and the 1st Battalion—were able to slip past the American forces and reach friendly lines further west. The Americans counted 558 Japanese dead around the Sea Horse, mostly from the 124th's 3rd Battalion, and captured 17.<ref>Frank, pp. 562–563; Miller, pp. 289–290, 296; Jersey, pp. 361, 372. Miller states that the Japanese strongpoint was {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} west of the Sea Horse, not {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} as Frank claims. Jersey notes that the Japanese defenders of the ridge strongpoint may have been from the 3rd Battalion, 230th Regiment commanded by Major Ampei Onada. Jersey claims that Oka was killed during the Ke evacuation (Jersey, pp. 371–372).</ref>

===Second Mount Austen===
On 9 January, McClure's 2nd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Peters—replaced the three battalions from the 132nd Regiment and prepared to assault the Gifu. Over the next four days, the Americans tried to feel out the Japanese positions with patrols. At the same time, the Gifu defenders attempted to wear down the Americans with night infiltration attacks. By 13 January, the 2nd Battalion had lost 57 killed or wounded. The battle casualties plus malaria reduced the battalion to 75% of its effective strength by the next day. To assist the battalion, the 35th Regiment's anti-tank gun company personnel were attached to the battalion as infantry.<ref>Frank, pp. 563–564; Miller, pp. 290–294.</ref>
[[File:Guad25thWouded.jpg|thumb|left|An injured American soldier from the 35th Infantry Regiment is prepared for evacuation from the battle area on 15 January.]]

With the capture of the Sea Horse by the Americans, the Japanese in the Gifu were isolated from the rest of the 17th Army. In a last message over his field phone before the line was cut, Inagaki refused an order from Oka to abandon his position and attempt to infiltrate back to friendly lines, instead vowing that his command would "fight to the last". Inagaki apparently refused the order because to do so would have meant leaving his sick and injured men behind.<ref>Frank, p. 564; Miller, p. 296; Griffith, p. 278.</ref>

An American attack on the Gifu by the entire 2nd Battalion on 15 January was completely repulsed by the Japanese. In response, McClure relieved Peters of command on 16 January and replaced him with Major [[Stanley R. Larsen]]. Larsen decided to completely surround the Gifu and try to reduce it with a massive artillery bombardment on 17 January.<ref>Frank, pp. 564–565; Miller, pp. 295–298; Anderson; Jersey, pp. 367–369. Jersey says Peters was relieved for, "not implementing an order" (Jersey p. 367).</ref>

In the meantime, the Americans used a loudspeaker to broadcast a surrender appeal in Japanese to the Gifu's defenders. Only five Japanese soldiers responded. One of the five reported that his company actually gathered to discuss the appeal but decided not to surrender because they were too weak to carry their injured, non-ambulatory comrades with them to the American lines. Instead, they elected to perish together as a unit. One Japanese officer defending the Gifu wrote in his diary, "I heard the enemy talking in Japanese over a loud speaker. He is probably telling us to come out—what fools the enemy are. The Japanese Army will stick it out to the end. Position must be defended in all conditions with our lives."<ref>Frank, p. 565; Miller, pp. 298–299; Jersey, p. 369.</ref>

At 14:30 on 17 January, twelve [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]] and thirty-seven 105&nbsp;mm guns opened fire on the Gifu. Over the next one and a half hours, the American artillery fired 1,700 shells into an area about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} square. Because of the lateness of the hour, the Americans were unable to follow the barrage with an immediate attack but instead had to wait until the next day, which allowed the Japanese time to recover. On 18 January, the Americans attacked into the weaker west side of the Gifu, making some headway and destroying several Japanese pillboxes over the next two days until heavy rain stopped the attack on 20 January. That night, eleven Japanese were killed trying to escape from the Gifu.<ref>Frank, pp. 565–566; Miller, pp. 298–303. The U.S. artillery units involved included the 105-mm howitzers of the 88th Field Artillery Battalion, one 105-mm howitzer of the 8th, and the 155-mm howitzers of the 90th and 221st Field Artillery Battalions in addition to the 105-mm. howitzers of the 64th Field Artillery Battalion.</ref>
[[File:GuadGifuJan22-23.gif|thumb|right|Tank support cracks the Gifu for American forces]]

On 22 January, the Americans were able to move a [[Stuart tank|light tank]] up their supply trail to Mount Austen. The tank proved to be the decisive factor in the battle. At 10:20, the tank—protected by 16–18 riflemen—blasted three Japanese pillboxes and penetrated into the Gifu pocket. Proceeding onward, the tank completely traversed the Gifu and destroyed five more pillboxes, breaching a gap {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide in the Japanese line. The American infantry surged through the gap and took positions in the middle of the Gifu.<ref>Frank, p. 566; Miller p. 303; Anderson; Jersey, p. 370; Gilbert, pp. 50–51. The tank was commanded by Captain Theodore Deese and crewed by men from the 25th Division Reconnaissance Troop. Three tanks, formerly belonging to Marine units on Guadalcanal, actually moved up to Mount Austen, but two were disabled in the process and were unable to participate in the attack.</ref>

That night around 02:30 on 23 January, apparently realizing the battle was lost, Inagaki led his staff and most of the remaining survivors of his command—about 100 men—in a final charge on the Americans. In the charge, Inagaki and the remainder of his troops were killed almost to the last man. At sunrise, the Americans secured the rest of the Gifu. Sixty-four men from the American 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry were killed during the assaults on the Gifu between 9&nbsp;and 23 January, bringing the total number of Americans killed taking Mount Austen to 175. The Americans counted the bodies of 431 Japanese in the remains of the Gifu's fortifications and 87 elsewhere around Mount Austen. Total Japanese losses in the Sea Horse and both Mount Austen battles were probably between 1,100 and 1,500 men.<ref>Frank, pp. 566–567; Miller, pp. 303–305; Anderson; Jersey, p. 371. Also killed in the final Japanese charge was Major Nishihata, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment.</ref>

===Coastal drive===
At the same time that the U.S. Army offensive was taking place in the hills around the upper Matanikau, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division—under the command of Brigadier General [[Alphonse DeCarre]]—was attacking along the north coast of Guadalcanal. Facing the Marines in the hills and ravines south of Point Cruz were the remains of the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Masao Maruyama (Japanese Army officer)|Masao Maruyama]], plus the 1st Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment from the 38th Infantry Division under Major Kikuo Hayakawa.<ref>Frank, p. 556; Miller, pp. 278–279; Jersey, pp. 304, 344–345, 356, 361; Hough, pp. 363–364. Jersey states that the 228th Regiment's command post was also located in this area but doesn't say if this post included Major General Takeo Ito or just the regimental commander, Doi and/or Suemura. The 228th's 1st Battalion was located on Hills 75, 78, and 80, called ''Sakai Dai'' or "Skyline Ridge" by the Japanese.</ref>
[[File:GuadMatanikauJan13-18.gif|thumb|left|U.S. Marine drive along the coast]]

On 13 January, the [[2nd Marine Regiment|2nd]] and [[8th Marine Regiment|8th]] Marine regiments began their offensive with the 8th Marines attacking along the coast and the 2nd Marines advancing further inland. The Japanese were pushed back in some places but held in others, with heavy fighting occurring at several locations in the hills and ravines near the coast. On 14 January, the 2nd Marines were relieved by the [[6th Marine Regiment]] under the command of Colonel [[Gilder D. Jackson Jr.|Gilder D. Jackson]].<ref>Frank, pp. 556–557; Miller, pp. 278–279; Hough, p. 365; Shaw, pp. 49–50; Zimmerman, pp. 159–160, 164; Jersey, pp. 364, 366. The 6th Marines were commanded by Colonel Gilder D. Jackson.</ref>

The Marines renewed the offensive on 15 January. The Japanese stymied the 8th Marines' advance along the coast. Inland, however, the 6th Marines were able to successfully advance about {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} and threatened the flank of the Japanese forces emplaced in front of the 8th Marines. At 17:00, Maruyama ordered his troops to retreat to a pre-coordinated line about {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}} to the west.<ref>Frank, p. 557; Miller, p. 279; Hough pp. 365–366; Jersey, pp. 364–365. The Marines used a flamethrower, captured earlier from the Japanese, in combat for the first time this day, destroying three Japanese emplacements.</ref>

Early on 16 January, as many of Maruyama's men attempted to comply with the order to retreat, the 6th Marines turned and drove to the coast, trapping most of Maruyama's 4th and 16th Regiments between themselves and the 8th Marines. By 14:00 on 17 January, the Marines had destroyed the Japanese forces trapped in the pocket, killing 643 and capturing two.<ref>Frank, pp. 557–558; Miller, p. 279; Hough, p. 367; Jersey, p. 369.</ref>

==Aftermath==
On 15 January, an IJA representative from Rabaul reached Guadalcanal on a Tokyo Express mission and informed Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw Japanese forces from the island. Grudgingly accepting the order, the 17th Army staff communicated the [[Operation Ke|''Ke'' evacuation plan]] to their forces on 18 January. The plan directed the 38th Division to disengage and withdraw towards [[Cape Esperance]] on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on 20 January. The 38th's retirement would be covered by the 2nd Division and other units, which would then follow the 38th westward. Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to "uphold the honor of the Imperial Army". From Cape Esperance the Japanese navy planned to evacuate the army forces over the last few days of January and first week of February with a projected completion date of the evacuation of 10 February.<ref>Frank, pp. 541, 562; Miller, p. 349; Jersey, p. 368; Griffith, pp. 279–284.</ref>
[[File:GuadKokumbonaJan23-25.gif|thumb|right|American advance westward, 23–25 January]]

The U.S. and its Allies mistook Japanese preparations for ''Ke'' as another reinforcement attempt. With this in mind, Patch ordered his forces to launch another offensive against the Japanese forces west of the Matanikau. On 21 January, the 27th and 161st Regiments pushed westward from the area of the Galloping Horse. The Americans—unaware that the 38th Division was withdrawing in preparation to evacuate the island—were surprised to encounter light resistance. Advancing more quickly through the inland hills and ridges than the Japanese had anticipated, by 22 January the Americans were in position to capture Kokumbona on the coast, headquarters of the 17th Army, and completely cut off the remainder of the 2nd Division.<ref>Frank, pp. 546, 568–570; Miller, pp. 319–329. On 22 January, Colonel [[James Dalton II]] relieved Colonel [[Clarence Orndorff]]—who was ill with malaria—as commander of the 161st (Miller, p. 346).</ref>

Reacting quickly to the situation, the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.<ref>Frank, p. 570; Miller, pp. 329–332.</ref>

Over the next week, the Japanese rear-guard—assisted by difficult terrain—effectively delayed the American advance westward from Kokumbona. General Patch—still believing that a Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent—kept most of his forces back to guard Henderson Field, sending only one regiment at a time to continue the advance. Thus, the majority of the surviving Japanese army forces was able to gather at Cape Esperance by the end of January. On 1, 4, and 7&nbsp;February, Japanese warships successfully evacuated 10,652 army troops from the island. On 9&nbsp;February, the Americans discovered that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure.<ref>Frank, pp. 571–572, 582–597; Miller, pp. 332–335, 338–349; Zimmerman, p. 164.</ref>

In hindsight, some historians have faulted the Americans—especially Patch and Admiral [[William Halsey]], commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific—for not taking advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Halsey had been recently repulsed at the [[Battle of Rennell Island]]. Patch and Harmon's insistence on taking Mount Austen has been cited as one of the factors that delayed the American's main attack to the west, giving the 17th Army a chance to escape. Said [[Merrill B. Twining]] of the Japanese forces deployed on and around Mount Austen, "Theoretically these Japanese did offer a threat to our major force advancing westward along the coast, but as a practical matter these isolated groups were composed of sick and starving men unable to do anything more than die in place. Under the circumstances disclosed by subsequent events, it is obvious that Mt. Austen was just part of the scenery and of no significant import to either of the antagonists."<ref>Frank, p. 597; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 348–350; Twining, p. 165.</ref>

Nevertheless, the larger successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the end of World War II.<ref>Frank, p. 597; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 348–350.</ref>

The theory of computation concerns abstract [[models of computation]] and general classes of [[computational problem|problems]] that can be solved using them. The fields of [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]] involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing [[security vulnerabilities]]. [[Computer graphics (computer science)|Computer graphics]] and [[computational geometry]] address the generation of images. [[Programming language theory]] considers different ways to describe computational processes, and [[database]] theory concerns the management of repositories of data. [[Human–computer interaction]] investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as [[operating system]]s, [[Computer network|network]]s and [[embedded system]]s investigate the principles and design behind [[complex system]]s. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, [[computer vision]] aims to understand and process image and video data, while [[natural language processing]] aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the [[abacus]] have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. [[Algorithm]]s for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Computer Science |url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html#:~:text=In%20the%201960%27s,%20computer%20science,person%20to%20receive%20a%20Ph. |access-date=2022-07-15 |website=cs.uwaterloo.ca |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729210116/https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html#:~:text=In%20the%201960%27s,%20computer%20science,person%20to%20receive%20a%20Ph. |url-status=live }}</ref>

The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is [[data science]]; this is now used for a [[multi-disciplinary]] field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.

In the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested (albeit facetiously) in the ''Communications of the ACM''—''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied [[epistemologist]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |date=<!-- missing! --> |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=6| doi = 10.1145/368796.368802|last1=Weiss |first1=E.A. |title=Letters to the editor |journal= Communications of the ACM |last2=Corley |first2=Henry P.T. |s2cid=5379449 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.<ref>Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4</ref> The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.<ref>IEEE Computer 28(12): p.136</ref> {{anchor|Name of the field in Europe}}In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "{{lang|it|informazione automatica}}" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g. {{lang|fr|informatique}} (French), {{lang|de|Informatik}} (German), {{lang|it|informatica}} (Italian, Dutch), {{lang|es|informática}} (Spanish, Portuguese), {{lang|sla|informatika}} ([[Slavic languages]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or {{lang|el-latn|pliroforiki}} ({{lang|el|πληροφορική|italic=no}}, which means informatics) in [[Greek language|Greek]].

A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—[[Edsger Dijkstra]], states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."<ref group=note>See the entry
"[[q:Computer science|Computer science]]" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.</ref> The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called information technology or [[information system]]s. However, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[Earth science]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.<ref name=Denning/> Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Alonzo Church]] and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].<ref name="Tedre2014"/>

The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Software engineering#Suitability|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tedre | first1 = M. | title = Computing as a Science: A Survey of Competing Viewpoints | doi = 10.1007/s11023-011-9240-4 | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–387 | year = 2011 | s2cid = 14263916 }}</ref> [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnas | first1 = D.L. | journal = Annals of Software Engineering | volume = 6 | pages = 19–37 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018949113292|title=Software engineering programmes are not computer science programmes| s2cid = 35786237 }}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [...]"</ref>

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

Nonetheless, they are experiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.<ref name = "plato"/>}} It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness of programs]], but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science.<ref name = "plato"/> Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in [[civil engineering]] and airplanes in [[aerospace engineering]].<ref name = "plato"/> They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.<ref name = "plato"/>

[[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]], formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE CS)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csab.org/ |title=CSAB Leading Computer Education |publisher=CSAB |date=August 3, 2011 |access-date=19 November 2011 |archive-date=January 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120190336/http://www.csab.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: ''theory of computation'', ''algorithms and data structures'', ''programming methodology and languages'', and ''computer elements and architecture''. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and [[symbolic computation]] as being important areas of computer science.<ref name="CSAB1997"/>

===Theoretical computer science===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
''Theoretical computer science'' is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.

====Theory of computation====

{{main|Theory of computation}}

According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be automated?"<ref name=DenningAutomated/> Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.

The famous [[P = NP?]] problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],<ref>[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P = NP {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> is an open problem in the theory of computation.

====Information and coding theory====

{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}

Information theory, closely related to [[probability]] and [[statistics]], is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by [[Claude Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 14, 2002 |last=P. Collins |first=Graham |title=Claude E. Shannon: Founder of Information Theory |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |work=Scientific American |access-date=December 12, 2014 |archive-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183558/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |url-status=live }}</ref>
Coding theory is the study of the properties of [[code]]s (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.

====Programming language theory and formal methods====
{{main|Programming language theory|Formal methods}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]]. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and [[linguistics]]. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of software and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems.<ref>Phillip A. Laplante, (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Software Engineering'' Three-Volume Set (Print). CRC Press. p. 309. {{ISBN|978-1-351-24926-3}}.</ref> The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

====Image and sound processing====
{{main|Data processing}}
[[Information]] can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. [[Bit]]s of information can be streamed via [[signal]]s. Its [[Data processing|processing]] is the central notion of informatics, the European view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier – whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. This field plays important role in [[information theory]], [[telecommunications]], [[information engineering]] and has applications in [[medical image computing]] and [[speech synthesis]], among others. ''What is the lower bound on the complexity of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms?'' is one of the [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problems in theoretical computer science]].

====Computational science, finance and engineering====
{{main|Computational science|Computational finance|Computational engineering}}
{{See also|List of computer-aided engineering software}}

[[Scientific computing]] (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[scientific]] problems. A major usage of scientific computing is [[simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,<ref>Muhammad H. Rashid, (2016). ''SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power''. CRC Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6047-2}}.</ref> as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for [[integrated circuit]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|title=What is an integrated circuit (IC)?

====Software engineering====
{{main|Software engineering}}
{{see also|Computer programming}}
Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance. For example [[software testing]], [[systems engineering]], [[technical debt]] and [[software development process]]es.

====Artificial intelligence====
{{main|Artificial intelligence|Bio-inspired computing}}

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], symbolic logic, [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing's question "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Can computers think?]]", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

====Computer architecture and microarchitecture====
{{main|Computer architecture|Microarchitecture|Computer engineering}}

Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.<ref>{{cite web|last=A. Thisted|first=Ronald|title=Computer Architecture |url=http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|publisher=The University of Chicago|date=April 7, 1997}}</ref> Computer engineers study [[computational logic]] and design of computer hardware, from individual [[Processor (computing)|processor]] components, [[microcontroller]]s, [[personal computer]]s to [[supercomputer]]s and [[embedded system]]s. The term "architecture" in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and [[Frederick P. Brooks Jr.]], members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959.

====Computer security and cryptography====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology with the objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.

Historical [[cryptography]] is the art of writing and deciphering secret messages. Modern cryptography is the scientific study of problems relating to distributed computations that can be attacked.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Katz|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137325053|title=Introduction to modern cryptography|date=2008|publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC|others=Yehuda Lindell|isbn=978-1-58488-551-1|location=Boca Raton|oclc=137325053|access-date=November 17, 2021|archive-date=May 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220506003141/http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137325053|url-status=live}}</ref> Technologies studied in modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric [[encryption]], [[digital signature]]s, [[cryptographic hash function]]s, [[key-agreement protocol]]s, [[blockchain]], [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, and [[garbled circuit]]s.

====Databases and data mining====
{{main|Database|Data mining}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s. Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets.

==Discoveries==
The philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last=Rapaport|first=William J.|date=20 September 2013|access-date=August 31, 2013|archive-date=February 14, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010214002845/http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".{{refn |group="note"|The word "anything" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}
:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
{{see also|Digital physics}}
* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:<ref>B. Jack Copeland, (2012). ''Alan Turing's Electronic Brain: The Struggle to Build the ACE, the World's Fastest Computer''. OUP Oxford. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960915-4}}.</ref>

{{see also|Turing machine}}
* [[Corrado Böhm]] and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only ''three ways of combining'' these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".<ref>Charles W. Herbert, (2010). ''An Introduction to Programming Using Alice 2.2''. Cengage Learning. p. 122. {{ISBN|0-538-47866-7}}.</ref>

:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
::*''sequence'': first do this, then do that;
::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.
:: The three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).
{{see also|Structured program theorem}}

==Programming paradigms==
{{main|Programming paradigm}}

Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:
* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.

* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, (2015). ''Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation''.

{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of [[conference papers]] is greater than that of journal publications.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Viewpoint: Research evaluation for computer science|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2009|volume=25|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1145/1498765.1498780|s2cid=8625066|url=https://pure.itu.dk/portal/da/publications/b474cea0-8288-11dd-b116-000ea68e967b }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=David|title=Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure|url=http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|publisher=Computing Research Association|date=August 1999|access-date=July 19, 2015|archive-date=July 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722020941/http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|url-status=live}}</ref> One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fortnow|first1=Lance|title=Viewpoint: Time for Computer Science to Grow Up|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=August 2009|volume=52|issue=8|pages=33–35|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536631|doi-access=free}}</ref>

'''John Silva Meehan''' (February 6, 1790 – April 24, 1863) was an American publisher, printer, and newspaper editor.  He served as the [[librarian of Congress]] from 1829 to 1861.

Born in New York City, Meehan worked as a printer in his youth. He briefly served in the [[U.S. Navy]] during the last few months of the [[War of 1812]]. He returned without seeing combat and began work as a publisher in [[Philadelphia]] alongside fellow printer Robert Anderson, publishing a [[Baptist]] religious journal. After the firm moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in early 1822, Meehan began editing and publishing the Baptist weekly newspaper ''The Columbian Star''. Leaving the ''Star'' in late 1825, Meehan nominally purchased the ''[[City of Washington Gazette]]'' on direction from [[Andrew Jackson]]'s presidential campaign, renaming the paper the ''United States' Telegraph'' and taking an immensely partisan stance. Jackson supporters considered Meehan unable to properly spearhead the press campaign. Control over the paper gradually shifted towards editor and publisher [[Duff Green]], with Meehan officially leaving the paper in October 1826; however, he continued to serve as Green's editorial assistant until 1829.

Following a purge of numerous incumbent officials in the aftermath of [[1828 United States presidential election|Jackson's 1828 election]], Meehan was appointed as librarian of Congress via the [[spoils system]] and with Green's urging, replacing the staunch anti-Jacksonian [[George Watterston]]. Meehan's tenure as librarian saw the steady growth of the [[Library of Congress]], collaborating with longstanding [[United States Congressional Joint Committee on the Library|Joint Committee on the Library]] chair [[James Pearce]] for most of his tenure. A large fire in December 1851 destroyed 35,000 of the library's 55,000 books. Meehan and Pearce oversaw the reconstruction of the library after the disaster, restocking it with substantial purchases of books and rebuilding the main hall. The [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860 prompted Meehan's removal in 1861 in favor of Indiana physician [[John Gould Stephenson]]. Largely unbothered by this, he retired gracefully and died suddenly in 1863. Both Stephenson and later historians were generally critical of Meehan's tenure, noting that he mainly deferred to the Joint Committee on library policy, leaving the library's archaic catalog system unchanged, and failing to make any progress in transforming the institution into a true [[national library]].

== Early life ==
John Silva Meehan was born in New York City on February 6, 1790. Little is recorded of his early life. He attended school in New York and later entered work as a printer. In 1811 or 1812, he moved to [[Burlington, New Jersey]], to work as a printer at Lexicon Press under publisher David Allinson. There, Meehan helped print Richard S. Coxe's ''New Critical Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language''. He met Margaret Jones Monington, from Burlington, and married her in 1814.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=3}}{{Sfn|Mearns|1947|p=36}}

[[File:USS Firefly 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|1857 depiction of the ''[[USS Firefly]]''|alt=A drawing of a ship in choppy seas]]

In January 1815, Meehan returned to New York to enlist in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. He served as a [[midshipman]] on the [[USS Firefly|USS ''Firefly'']] during the [[War of 1812]]. The ''Firefly'' was the flagship of a small group of commerce raiders in the [[West Indies]]. Shortly afterwards, the ratification of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] concluded the war. The ''Firefly'' did not see action, to the disappointment of Meehan and the rest of the crew. Leaving service in April 1815, he moved to [[Philadelphia]] and declined an offered [[Commission (document)|commission]] in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] to focus on his printing career. His first daughter, Susan, was born the same month.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=3–4}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|p=29}}

== Publishing career ==
[[File:Columbian Star October 22 1824 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Masthead of ''[[The Columbian Star]]'', October 23, 1824|alt=A newspaper masthead]]

In Philadelphia, Meehan partnered with fellow printer Robert Anderson to create the Anderson & Meehan firm. They began publishing the ''Latter Day Luminary'' in 1818, a Baptist General Conference-sponsored religious journal published five times a year. The firm moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in early 1822, and the ''Luminary'' was shifted to a monthly publication. In February 1822, soon after moving to Washington, Anderson & Meehan also began publishing ''[[The Columbian Star]]'', self-described as an apolitical Baptist weekly newspaper.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=3–4}}{{Sfn|Millington|1925|p=50}} The two served as the chief editors of the paper for about a year, before editorship was transferred to Reverend James D. Knowles.{{Sfn|Millington|1925|p=50}} Alongside the two regular publications, the firm would occasionally publish other items, such as pamphlets. Anderson left the ''Star'' in early 1823 and the ''Luminary'' by the end of that year, leaving Meehan as the sole publisher. Knowles left the ''Star'' in July 1825, making Meehan the editor of the paper. Six months later Meehan left the paper, seeking not to associate the largely apolitical ''Star'' with his entry into political writing. He transferred publication and editorship of the ''Star'' to [[Baron Stow]] and discontinued the ''Luminary''.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=3–4}}

=== ''United States' Telegraph'' ===
{{Main article|United States' Telegraph}}

Following his narrow loss in a House [[contingent election]] after the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], Tennessee senator [[Andrew Jackson]] and his former running mate [[John C. Calhoun]] sought a supportive newspaper in Washington, D.C.{{Sfn|Ewing|1978|p=128}} The Jackson campaign indirectly purchased [[Jonathan Elliot (publisher)|Jonathan Elliot]]'s ''[[City of Washington Gazette]]'' through allies [[William Berkeley Lewis|William B. Lewis]] and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]]. Although Meehan ostensibly purchased the paper, Eaton likely directed the purchase. Meehan served as the first publisher and chief editor of the paper, which was renamed the ''United States' Telegraph''. The newspaper entered publication on February 6, 1826.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|p=9}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=4}}{{Sfn|Mearns|1947|p=37}} The ''Telegraph'' was published in weekly, thrice-weekly, and daily editions, available by subscription. From the outset, the paper was immensely partisan, strongly opposed to the election of President [[John Quincy Adams]] and the appointment of Secretary of State [[Henry Clay]]. It declared that these violated "the most sacred principles of [[Constitution of the United States|the Constitution]]" due to the contingent election and adopted the motto "Power is always stealing from the many to the few."{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=4–5}}{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=81–82}}

As editor, Meehan heavily criticized the system of executive patronage (also known as the [[spoils system]]). He attacked the appointment of an anti-Jacksonian postmaster in Jackson's hometown of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], claiming the appointment was solely made to "mortify" Jackson.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=82–83}} Meehan also emphasized defending Jackson's reputation, describing him as an "abused citizen" and claiming that Jackson was above the political games and corruption that he attributed to the Adams administration. [[National Republican Party|National Republican]]-aligned newspapers began to oppose the ''Telegraph'', with ''[[The National Intelligencer]]'' and [[National Journal (newspaper)|''National Journal'']] claiming Meehan's editorials amounted to "indiscriminate opposition".{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=83–84}}

Soon after he acquired the paper, Jacksonians began to worry that Meehan lacked the ferocity and boldness needed to support the campaign. Although Meehan was recognized for his strong anti-Adams advocacy through the ''Telegraph'', the ownership of the paper grew uncomfortable with his perceived inability to mount an effective response against the administration. The lack of transparency around the formation of the ''Telegraph'' invited allegations of conspiracy. The ''[[Richmond Whig]]'' described the paper as "edited by nobody knows whom, supported, nobody knows how".{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=81–82}}

Missouri editor and politician [[Duff Green]] was summoned to Washington by prominent Jacksonians to take over the ''Telegraph''.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=26}} He published several editorials in the paper and offered to purchase it after strong rebuttals from the ''National Journal''. Green borrowed large amounts of money from Jacksonian politicians, including Eaton, to finance this purchase. An official deal between Meehan and Green was reached on June 5, 1826, purchasing the paper and its printing office.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=85–86}} Meehan was hired as Green's assistant for a three-year term. Green soon left to travel the country, and Meehan continued serving as the ''de facto'' chief editor of the paper for several months. During this period, Meehan clashed with the pro-administration press on several issues, including Adams' alleged purchase of a [[Billiard table|billiards table]] and the military significance of Jackson's victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]].{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=85–89}}

The last issue of the ''Telegraph'' featuring Meehan's name was published on October 17, 1826. No official statement was made regarding the change of ownership. While working as Green's publisher, Meehan additionally served as the secretary of the board of trustees of the Baptist [[George Washington University|Columbian College]].{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=5}}{{Sfn|Smith|1981|p=134}}

== Librarian of Congress ==
=== Appointment ===
Upon Jackson's election in 1828, the incoming administration began a mass shift of government positions in favor of supportive [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] via the [[spoils system]]. [[George Watterston]], the [[librarian of Congress]] since 1815, had strong connections to many of Jackson's opponents, including Henry Clay. Watterston was later described by historian [[David C. Mearns]] as having been a "librarian of one side of the aisle".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=107–109}}{{Sfn|Mearns|1947|p=36}} Jackson originally intended to replace Watterston with Charles P. Tutt, but Tutt declined in favor of a position as U.S. Navy Agent at [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=31–32}}

Green wrote to Andrew Jackson on April 23, 1829, recommending Meehan as Watterston's replacement for librarian of Congress. Green, in increasing amounts of debt, wished to hire an assistant editor at a lower rate than that agreed for Meehan.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|p=134}} Biographer Christian Nappo described the letter as significantly embellishing Meehan's scholarly capabilities and his appointment itself as "purely an act of political patronage".{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=31–32}}

}}

Meehan was officially appointed as librarian on May 28, 1829. Clay, angered by the appointment, compared Watterston's removal to the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]].{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}} The ''[[New-England Palladium]]'' condemned Watterston's removal but conceded that Meehan was ultimately "an amiable and respectable man" and preferable to other possible Jacksonian candidates.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=31–32}} The strongly anti-Jacksonian ''National Journal'' and Meehan's former ''United States' Telegraph'' extensively covered Meehan's appointment, debating the legality of the move. Jacksonian press attacked Watterston's character, describing him as pompous and impractical.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=107–109}}

Debates over the appointment also reflected broader attitudes towards the future of the library. Rather than simply providing for Congress, Watterston sought to transform the [[Library of Congress]] into a comprehensive [[national library]] aimed at the education of the general public, which Jacksonians feared would represent increased federal power. However, Jackson may have been unaware of Watterston's plans when initially appointing Meehan.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=103, 107–109}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=255}}

Watterston himself was indignant at his replacement, describing Meehan as "very ordinary" and unfitting for the Library of Congress.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=107–109}} He repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim the position for the rest of his life, through what biographer John McDonough described as a mix of "cajolery, threats, and flattery".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}} Despite his past as a partisan editor, Meehan remained a relatively apolitical librarian, and he retained his position through multiple [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presidencies.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=22}}

=== Tenure ===
[[File:Capitol of the U.S. at Washington 1825 (cropped).tif|thumb|1825 depiction of the [[U.S. Capitol]]. The Library of Congress would occupy a portion of the building until 1897.{{Sfn|Cole|1972|p=270}}|alt=A painting of the U.S. Capitol in 1825]]

When Meehan took office, the library was situated within the western portion of the [[U.S. Capitol]], and contained about 16,000 books.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}} He wrote in irritation at the conditions within the library, describing the various maintenance tasks needed to restore damaged books, clean shelves, and remove [[Bookworm (insect)|bookworms]]. In July 1832, Congress approved expansions to the [[Law Library of Congress]], designating a nearby room to hold the slightly over 2,000 [[law book]]s held in the collections. Around this time, Meehan appointed his son C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Wharton Meehan, previously employed as his assistant, to head the Law Library.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}}

From the outset, Meehan collaborated with the Congressional [[United States Congressional Joint Committee on the Library|Joint Committee on the Library]], often deferring to its advice regardless of partisan lines. He worked closely with the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] [[Edward Everett]] during the early 1830s. Maryland Senator [[James Pearce]] was appointed chairman of the Joint Committee in 1845, beginning a long-running period of close collaboration between him and Meehan. Historian Carl Ostrowski described Meehan as having "never made a move without first consulting Pearce".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=9–11}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=257}} Ostrowski characterized the Joint Committee during this period as negligent to the library, often not meeting or failing to achieve a quorum.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=113}}

The Joint Committee was generally on the forefront of management during the 1830s and 1840s. ''[[National Intelligencer]]'' coverage in the mid-1830s attributed the Library's holdings to various members of the committee, briefly praising Meehan for his "civility and attention" to visitors.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=109–110}} In contrast to Watterston's prominent role in discussion of American libraries, he is not mentioned within 1830s periodicals on American libraries.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=109–110}}

==== Cataloguing and acquisitions ====
A steady appropriation of {{Usd|5,000}} a year for the purchase of books, plus an additional {{Usd|1,000}}–{{Usd|2,000}} for law books, was allocated to Meehan throughout his career with occasional exceptions. Meehan steadily acquired books, although he was criticized for prioritizing the acquisition of popular books over scholarly concerns.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=8}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=124}} Journalist [[Anne Royall]] rebuked him for his purchasing habits, claiming he had failed to "anticipate the research needs of legislators or scholars" and criticizing the acquisition of numerous books intended for [[Sunday school]] students.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}} Two major opportunities were presented to purchase expansive collections but were both denied by Congress, with Meehan doing little to advocate for the prospect. An 1836 offer to purchase Russian nobleman [[Dmitry Buturlin]]'s multilingual collection of 25,000 books was denied by a 17–16 vote. An offer in 1844 to acquire the [[Durazzo family]] library, containing over 10,000 volumes, was rejected for largely containing non-English literature.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=9}}

Classification systems in the library were archaic, with shelves placed in accordance with a modified version of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s original classification schema, itself based off the [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] conceptualization of knowledge. Books were generally categorized by subject and within subjects by size.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=121}} Library catalogs divided books by subject, with books within each subject listed alphabetically. Many years passed between different general catalogs of the library, requiring the consultation of additional supplementary listings.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}} A new catalog was produced in 1839, the first since 1830. The total number of volumes in the library had increased to around 30,000, encompassing 10,746 titles.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=121}} Over time, the time-intensive task of cataloging new entries was delegated to Meehan's assistant, E.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Stelle. The limited space and resources available to the library strongly limited the number of books which could be received. In 1849, Meehan wrote to the library's book agent [[Obadiah Rich]], noting that the "rooms for the accommodation of our Library are now so thoroughly filled, that we find it very difficult to take in any more books."{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=267}} Due to his reputation as a skilled businessman, Meehan was tasked by Congress to manage and book-keep what biographer John McDonough labeled a "bewildering variety of special funds" in addition to his duties within the library. Many of these were publishing or printing funds, with specific funds for the republication of the works of [[John Adams]], Thomas Jefferson, [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[James Madison]], as well as publications on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] and the Library of Congress catalog. Additional funds placed on Meehan's caseload included the funding for [[George Peter Alexander Healy|G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Healy]]'s portraits of presidents, a fund to acquire art for display at the Capitol, and the [[United States Botanic Garden]] Fund, which at times forced Meehan to supervise the garden's workers and handle correspondence with Congressmen seeking plant specimens for their home gardens.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=12}}[[File:Alexandre Vattemare Boston.png|alt=A black and white photograph of an aged Alexandre Vattemare near the end of his life|thumb|[[Alexandre Vattemare]]'s ineffective attempts at a transatlantic document exchange system frustrated Meehan.]]In 1840, French [[ventriloquist]] and actor [[Alexandre Vattemare]] received federal support for his proposed government document exchange system between the United States and France. Meehan provided Vattemare with 700 volumes of congressional documents, an amount "said to be twice as large as any in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]".{{Sfn|Gwinn|2010|p=109}} Widespread American enthusiasm for the program led to a massive quantity of documents, which Vattemare was unable to manage effectively. Meehan grew increasingly upset with the poor condition of shipments received through the program, describing the documents as poor quality and incomplete.{{Sfn|Gwinn|2010|pp=111–112}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=20–21}} At least two French diplomatic officials contacted Meehan and asked him not to pursue exchanges through Vattemare.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=113}} Congress terminated the program in June 1853. Despite this, Vattemare continued sporadic and unwanted shipments of books to the Library of Congress. The final shipment was sent in 1858, leading to a frustrated response from Meehan and the return of Vattemare's shipment, unopened.{{Sfn|Gwinn|2010|pp=111–112}}

==== Fire of 1851 and aftermath ====
Slightly before 8:00{{Nbsp}}am on December 24, 1851, [[1851 Library of Congress fire|a large fire]] broke out in the main room of the Library of Congress. Meehan was quickly summoned to the scene. Freezing temperatures impaired fire hoses, slowing efforts to put out the fire. While the main room was essentially unsalvageable, books in adjacent rooms were quickly moved to safety. A number of [[fire engine]] crews, alongside a group of nearby [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], were able to extinguish the blaze by around 11:00{{Nbsp}}am. About 35,000 of the library's 55,000 books were destroyed, alongside various paintings and statues. An inquiry was launched over the coming days to investigate the cause of the fire: after testimony from Meehan, [[Thomas Ustick Walter|Thomas U. Walter]], the [[Architect of the Capitol]], determined that the fire was sparked by the timbers of library alcoves extending into a [[chimney-flue]]. Any potential censures or charges were dismissed.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=35–36}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=12–13}}

[[File:James Alfred Pearce, standing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Senator [[James Pearce]] served as Meehan's partner and ally for much of his tenure as librarian.|alt=A black and white photo of James Pearce]]

Pearce comforted Meehan in the aftermath of the 1851 fire, leading him to describe Pearce as "so eminent a gentleman, and so discriminating a friend".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=15}} Together with Walter, they worked steadily on rebuilding efforts over the course of 1852. Congress authorized various appropriations to finance the reconstruction of the library and the repurchase of lost books. By March 1852, temporary facilities for the library had been finished. The construction process of the main library faced numerous delays, irritating Meehan. While Walter had promised in March that the work would be completed in three months, the reconstruction of the main room was not finished until early 1853. Despite these delays, Meehan was extremely pleased with the library room, calling it "truly beautiful".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=15}}[[File:Library of Congress 1853 (cropped).jpg|alt=A drawing showing the interior of a multistory library|thumb|View of the library {{Circa|1853}}, following rebuilding]]Meehan commissioned [[Rich Brothers]], a London-based book dealing firm, to restock the library. His purchasing efforts were criticized by an anonymous two-part ''[[National Intelligencer]]'' article (sometimes attributed to [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] librarian [[Charles Coffin Jewett]]) stating that an agent should have been sent overseas to purchase books and that the Library of Congress should have attempted to become "a systematic collection of books chosen with competent bibliographic learning for a specific and well-defined purpose".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=16}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|p=36}} Meehan rebuked the anonymous author, writing that such efforts would place "Congress in a position which admits that they cannot select the books they need."{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=16}}

Meehan diligently produced various "want lists" based on earlier catalogs.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=16–17}} Although control over what books the library was to purchase had been shifted from the Joint Committee to the librarian of Congress, Meehan reassured Pearce that the prior system was still in effect and that he did not intend to expand his control over book acquisition.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=16–17}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=260}} Congressman and educational reformer [[Horace Mann]] submitted a resolution to the committee shortly before his congressional retirement in March 1853, calling for the library to accept any of the lost books if offered at a cheaper price than other sellers. This was strongly opposed by Pearce and Meehan, who preferred the ease of purchases through the Rich Brothers. In response, they waited out Mann's retirement and the beginning of the [[33rd United States Congress]] and continued the previous path.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=260}}

The library's collections were restored by early 1856, following the purchase of 36,000 books at a "cost very far below the prices given for the lost books" through Rich Brothers.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=20}} Increased annual funding for the library, on top of various special appropriations, enabled the rapid growth of the library over the following years.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=18}} An attempt by Jewett and the Smithsonian Institution to re-catalog the library ended after criticism from Meehan. Rumors that President [[Franklin Pierce]] had appointed a new librarian of Congress troubled Meehan. After consultation with Pearce, he met with Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]], who reassured him that the rumors were unfounded. Secretary of State [[Lewis Cass]] of the succeeding Buchanan administration also reaffirmed Meehan's position as librarian.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=21–22}}

=== Removal ===
Following [[1860 United States presidential election|the election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the ensuing [[Ordinance of Secession|secession of the southern states]] in late 1860 and early 1861, Meehan's position became increasingly unstable. [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford|Ainsworth Spofford]] described him as a "very ancient fossil", and rumors began to circulate of pro-Southern sympathies.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=22–23}} Pearce wrote to Lincoln in March 1861, asking that Meehan be allowed to continue his role as librarian. Following extensive lobbying and support from various Midwestern Republicans, Indiana physician and Lincoln campaign delegate [[John Gould Stephenson]] was able to convince Lincoln to choose him for the position. Stephenson officially accepted his appointment on May 24, 1861, and Meehan left his duties at the end of the month.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=22–23}}{{Sfn|Carter|1976|pp=78–81}}

=== Legacy ===
Stephenson, Meehan's successor, complained that the library had fallen into disrepair and neglect. A December 1861 report commissioned by Stephenson (possibly written by Spofford) noted large numbers of uncleaned, miscataloged, and misplaced books. The cataloguing and purchasing systems were also noted to be deficient. Stephenson considered much of Meehan's library staff incompetent and initiated a mass change of staff; Meehan's son, Law Library head C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Wharton Meehan, became the sole retained assistant.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=24}}{{Sfn|Carter|1976|p=81}}

Later historians called into question Meehan's abilities as librarian, criticizing his inability to transform the Library of Congress into a [[national library]]. In his 1904 ''History of the Library of Congress'', historian William Dawson Johnston described Meehan as unable to foresee future needs of the library but able to maintain his position due to possessing "the second qualification of a successful administrator, that is, business ability".{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=32–33}}{{Sfn|Johnston|1904|p=215}} Historian Carl Ostrowski was also critical of Meehan's contributions to the library, noting in 2000 that he chose to exercise little influence over any area of library policy.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=257}}

== Personal life and death ==
Meehan and his wife Margaret had seven children. Margaret died during childbirth in July 1826, followed by her infant later the same day. Meehan remarried in October 1827 to Rachel T. Monington, his wife's sister, and the two would go on to have two more children together. Only three of Meehan's children outlived him.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=5}}

A year after leaving office, Meehan sought a position as a [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] clerk due to financial concerns. Pearce and [[William P. Fessenden]] wrote to Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] on Meehan's behalf to advocate for his employment.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=24–28}} In the afternoon of April 24, 1863, Meehan suddenly died from [[apoplexy]] in his home in [[Capitol Hill]], Washington. An obituary described him as "[leaving] to his family that best inheritance, an unsullied name."{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=25}} C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Wharton Meehan continued in his role as custodian of the Law Library until his own death in July 1872.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=8}}
