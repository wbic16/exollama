## Coordinates

Wikipedia articles have a number of features we want to preserve in phext.

1. Revision History
2. Article
3. Talk
4. Rendered HTML

Pages on Wikipedia are created with plain text article names. Ideally, you should be able to directly jump to a corresponding coordinate without consulting a lookup table.

Let's take a look at a typical page name (page of the day from Feb 5, 2025):
John_Silva_Meehan

This 17-digit identifier wastes a lot of address space. Traditionally, that might bother us, and encourage an offset+lookup-based approach. Phext excels at sparse dimensional traversal, however, so let's just roll with it.

According to Wikipedia, article titles are unique and serve as primary keys. For the sake of this experiment, we will consider article titles of up to 1,000 characters - on the assumption that users prefer URLs they can actually fit on a screen.

We'll use the first 6 coordinates of this document to orient ourselves within a wikipedia-centric volume that aligns with the structure of the article title that we're consuming. The remaining 3 coordinates can be used to encode metadata as needed.

We'll use this numbering convention:
* 1.1.1 Article
* 1.1.2 Oldest Revision
* 1.1.3 Second Oldest Revision
* 1.1.N Newest Revision (Just keep appending scrolls for snapshots)
* 1.2.1 Talk Page
* 1.3.x Translations
* 1.4+.x Reserved
* 2.x.x+ Reserved

The 6D high-level structure is broken down as follows (using 
John_Silva_Meehan as an example):

- J15N (convert title to uppercase, string length, first + last)
  - The internationalization (i18n) structure directly encodes LB.SF.SR
- First Three Words in similar format, XOR'd
  - J2N xor S3A xor M4N

The '''Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse''', part of which is sometimes called the '''Battle of the Gifu''', took place from 15 December 1942 to 23 January 1943 and was primarily an [[Engagement (military)|engagement]] between United States and [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces in the hills near the [[Matanikau River]] area on [[Guadalcanal]] during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. The U.S. forces were under the overall command of Major General [[Alexander Patch]] and the Japanese forces were under the overall command of Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]].

In the battle, U.S. [[United States Army|soldiers]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], assisted by native [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Islanders]], attacked [[Imperial Japanese Army]] forces defending well-fortified and entrenched positions on several hills and ridges. The most prominent hills were called [[Mount Austen]], the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse by the Americans. The U.S. was attempting to destroy the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal, and the Japanese were trying to hold their defensive positions until reinforcements could arrive.

Both sides experienced extreme difficulties in fighting in the thick jungles and tropical environment of the battle area. Many of the American troops were also involved in their first combat operations. The Japanese were mostly cut off from resupply and suffered greatly from malnourishment and lack of medical care. After some difficulty, the U.S. succeeded in taking Mount Austen, in the process reducing a strongly defended position called the Gifu, as well as the Galloping Horse and the Sea Horse. In the meantime, the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal and withdrew to the west coast of the island. From there most of the surviving Japanese troops [[Operation Ke|were successfully evacuated]] during the first week of February 1943.

==Background==

===Guadalcanal campaign===
Eight months after the beginning of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pacific War]], on 7&nbsp;August 1942 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] for threatening the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a [[Military campaign|campaign]] with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]]. The landings initiated the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal campaign]].<ref>Hogue, pp. 235–236.</ref>

The Japanese were taken by surprise. By nightfall on 8&nbsp;August, the 11,000 Allied troops—primarily from the [[1st Marine Division]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] under the command of Lieutenant General [[Alexander Vandegrift]]—[[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo|secured Tulagi]] and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at [[Lunga Point]] on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the airfield [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the "[[Cactus Air Force]]" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20,000.<ref>Morison, pp. 14–15; Miller, p. 143; Frank, p. 338; and Shaw, p. 18.</ref>
[[File:Map of Solomons area in 1942.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The Solomon Islands. "The Slot" ([[New Georgia Sound]]) runs down the center of the islands, from Bougainville and the Shortlands (center) to Guadalcanal (lower right). Rabaul on [[New Britain]] is at the upper center.]]

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] assigned the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|17th Army]]—a [[corps]]-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]]—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August to drive Allied forces from the island.<ref>Griffith, pp. 96–99; Dull, p. 225; Miller, pp. 137–138.</ref>

Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the [[Shortland Islands]] to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships—mainly [[light cruiser]]s or [[destroyer]]s from the [[IJN 8th Fleet|Eighth Fleet]] under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Gunichi Mikawa]]—were usually able to make the round trip down "[[New Georgia Sound#WWII—The Slot|The Slot]]" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "[[Tokyo Express]]" by the Allies and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.<ref>Frank, pp. 202, 210–211.</ref>

Using forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner, the Japanese tried three times to retake Henderson Field, but they were defeated each time. First, a reinforced battalion from the 28th Infantry Regiment was defeated in the [[Battle of the Tenaru]] on 21 August. Next, the augmented 35th Infantry Brigade was defeated in the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]] on 12–14 September. Finally, the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Infantry Division]] augmented by one regiment from the [[38th Infantry Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|38th Infantry Division]] was defeated with heavy losses in the [[Battle for Henderson Field]] on 23–26 October.<ref>Frank, pp. 141–158, 218–246, 337–367.</ref>
[[File:GuadMapAug7.jpg|thumb|right|Guadalcanal. Lunga Point and Mount Austen are at the upper-center-left of the map.]]

Throughout the campaign, the Japanese used Mount Austen (called Bear Height by the Japanese and Mount Mambulu by the local Solomon Islanders), west of the [[Lunga River (Guadalcanal)|Lunga River]] and about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Henderson Field, to observe the American defenses around Lunga Point. Emplaced artillery on Mount Austen delivered harassing fire on Henderson Field. The hill was also used as a defensive point to protect their positions around the upper Matanikau valley as well as to protect the Maruyama Road, which was a trail used by the Japanese to move men and supplies into the interior of the island. Mount Austen—with a summit of {{convert|1514|ft|m|abbr=on}}—was not a single peak but a mixed ridgeline of rocky exposed and jungle-covered ridges and hilltops. After the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field, the Army Section of Imperial General Headquarters directed Hyakutake to increase the numbers of troops and artillery emplaced on the ridgeline to help prepare for the next planned attack on the Americans. Hyakutake directed some of the units that were retreating from the Henderson Field battle area to fortify Mount Austen and nearby hilltops. The forces deployed to Mount Austen included the 124th Infantry Regiment under Colonel [[Akinosuka Oka]] and several artillery units. Later, surviving troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment—which had taken heavy losses during the [[Koli Point action]] and [[Carlson's patrol|subsequent retreat]]—joined Oka's forces around Mount Austen.<ref>Frank, pp. 406–407, 411, 529; Miller, pp. 233–237; Jersey, pp. 344, 356, 360–362; Hough, pp. 363–364. The 8th Company, 230th Regiment took up positions near Mount Austen's summit. The 3rd Company, 10th Mountain Artillery under Captain Kyohtaroh Oishi with two 75mm [[Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun|Type 41]] mountain guns was located on Hill 89. Nearby were several more Type&nbsp;41 guns and crews from the 228th Infantry Howitzer Company. All were short of ammunition.</ref>

===Reinforcement and resupply===
On 5, 7, and 8 November, Tokyo Express missions landed most of the 38th Division's 228th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment on Guadalcanal. On 10 November, Japanese destroyers landed Lieutenant General [[Tadayoshi Sano]]—commander of the 38th Infantry Division—plus his staff and 600 more troops from the 38th. Hyakutake used the newly arrived troops to help stop [[Matanikau Offensive|an American attack]] west of the Matanikau from 8–11 November, then sent the 228th and 229th Regiment's units on 11 November to reinforce Oka's forces. Japanese [[Major General]] [[Takeo Itō]]—commander of the 38th Division's Infantry Group—later took command of the defenses around Mount Austen.<ref>Frank, pp. 421–425, 495; Miller, pp. 204, 228, 237; Jersey, pp. 303–304, 307, 361; Hough, pp. 363–364. At this time, Ito commanded about 1,000 troops of the 124th and 228th Infantry Regiments and supporting units on an inland line extending from Mount Austen to a point about {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} west. Of this force, Maj. Takeyosho Inagaki with the 2d Battalion, 228th Infantry, occupied the northeast slopes of Mount Austen. Colonel Oka, with part of the 124th Infantry and other units, held the center of the line between Mount Austen and the Matanikau, while Col. Masaichi Suemura commanded the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 228th Infantry on the high ground west of the Matanikau. The 228th Regiment was commanded by Colonel Sadashichi Doi. Doi was later killed on an unknown date by American artillery fire. Suemura may have taken command of the 228th after Doi's death (Jersey, pp. 303, 344, 368). The 229th and 230th Regiment's units were apparently scattered at various places among the Japanese positions.</ref>

An attempt by the Japanese to deliver the rest of the 38th Division and its heavy equipment failed during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 12–15 November. Only 2,000–3,000 of the remaining 7,000 troops from the division reached the island; most of their supplies, ammunition, and equipment were lost. Because of this failure, the Japanese canceled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.<ref>Frank, pp. 428–492.</ref>

As December began, the Japanese experienced considerable difficulty in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of [[Battle of Tassafaronga|Allied air and naval attacks]] on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7&nbsp;December were losing about 50&nbsp;men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 were still alive, with about 12,000 more or less fit for combat duty.<ref>Frank, pp. 493–527; Hough, pp. 364–365.</ref> On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken, Imperial General Headquarters, with approval from Emperor [[Hirohito]] on 31 December, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on [[New Georgia]]. The Japanese titled the evacuation effort of their forces from Guadalcanal ''[[Operation Ke]]'' (ケ号作戦) and planned to execute the operation beginning on 14 January 1943.<ref>Dull, pp. 261, 268; Miller, pp. 336–338; Griffith, pp. 268–269.</ref>
[[File:GuadPatch.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Army Major General [[Alexander Patch]] (foreground) observes the landing of troops and supplies on Guadalcanal on 8 December.]]

In the meantime, the U.S. continued to deliver additional troops to Guadalcanal. The three infantry regiments of the U.S. Army's [[Americal Division]], the [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th]], the [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd]] and the [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd]], were delivered to Guadalcanal on 13 October, 12 November, and 8&nbsp;December, respectively. In addition, the U.S. Army's independent 147th Infantry Regiment plus the [[2nd Marine Division]]'s [[8th Marine Regiment]] landed on 4&nbsp;November. The reinforcements also included additional artillery, construction, aviation, naval, and support units.<ref>Frank, pp. 247–252, 293, 417–420, 430–431, 521; Griffith, p. 156; Miller, pp. 143, 173–177, 183, 189; Jersey, pp. 304–305, 345–346; Hough, p. 360. The Americal Division infantry regiments were [[National Guard of the United States|national guard]] units. The 164th was from [[North Dakota]], the 182nd from [[Massachusetts]], and the 132nd from [[Illinois]]. The 147th had previously been part of the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]].</ref>

On 9 December, U.S. Army Major General [[Alexander Patch]]—commanding general of the Americal Division—succeeded Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi. That same day, the [[5th Marine Regiment]] departed the island, followed by the rest of the 1st Marine Division by the end of the month. Patch was ordered to eliminate all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal. Patch told his superior—[[Millard Harmon]], who commanded all U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific—that he needed more troops to accomplish his mission. In response, Harmon ordered the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], which was in the process of relocating from Hawaii to the [[South Pacific Area]], to ship directly to Guadalcanal. The 25th's units would arrive at Guadalcanal in stages during the last two weeks of December and the first week of January 1943. In addition, the rest of the 2nd Marine Division's units—including the [[6th Marine Regiment]]—were ordered to Guadalcanal during the same time period. By 7&nbsp;January, American forces on Guadalcanal would total just over 50,000 men.<ref>Miller, pp. 213–219; Frank, pp. 521–522, 529; Hough, pp. 359–360; Hough, pp. 360–362; Shaw, pp. 46–47; Zimmerman, pp. 156–157, 164; Jersey, pp. 363, 365; Griffith, pp. 257–259, 270. During its time on Guadalcanal, the 1st Marine Division suffered 650 killed, 31 missing, 1,278 injured, and 8,580 who contracted some type of disease, mainly [[malaria]]. The [[2nd Marine Regiment (United States)|2nd Marine Regiment]] had arrived at Guadalcanal with most of the 1st Marine Division, but remained behind to rejoin its parent unit, the 2nd Marine Division. The U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Division's 35th Regiment arrived at Guadalcanal on 17 December, the 27th Regiment on 1&nbsp;January, and the 161st Regiment on 4&nbsp;January. The 2nd Marine Division's headquarters units, the 6th Marine Regiment, and various Marine weapons and support units also arrived on 4&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;January. U.S. Major General John Marston, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, remained in New Zealand because he was superior in time in rank to Patch. Instead, Brigadier General Alphonse De Carre commanded the 2nd Marine Division on Guadalcanal. The total number of Marines on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 6&nbsp;January 1943 was 18,383.</ref>

===First Battle of Mount Austen===
On 12 December 1942, a small group of Japanese soldiers from the 38th Field Engineer Regiment successfully infiltrated the American lines from the south, destroying a fighter aircraft and a fuel truck on Henderson Field before escaping back to friendly lines. Two days later, a U.S. Army patrol from the 132nd Infantry Regiment skirmished with a group of Japanese on the eastern slopes of Mount Austen. On 15 December, in yet another night infiltration raid onto Henderson Field, a Lieutenant Ono led four men equipped with [[picric acid]] blocks past American sentry positions, destroying several [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39 Airacobra]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]].<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;46–47</ref> Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, Japanese forces would continue night infiltration tactics against U.S. forces, causing few American casualties.<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;46–47, 342</ref>

General Patch, however, was convinced that these events illustrated an unacceptable risk to Henderson Field by Japanese troops stationed on and around nearby Mount Austen. Thus, on 16 December, in preparation for a planned general offensive to try to destroy all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal, Patch elected to first secure the Mount Austen area. He therefore ordered the 132nd Infantry Regiment to immediately seize the objective. While the 132nd Infantry Regiment had little modern combat experience aside from jungle skirmishes and patrols, it was proud of its combat history, having participated in both the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and its young reserve officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned officers]] considered themselves skilled in rifle and machine-gun tactics and marksmanship.<ref>Frank, p. 529; Miller, pp. 231–237; Jersey, pp. 350–351; Anderson; Hough, pp. 363–364; Griffith, pp. 263–265; George, pp.&nbsp;18–20.</ref>
[[File:GuadGifuDec18-27.gif|thumb|right|Map of the First Battle of Mount Austen]]

The 132nd's commander—Colonel Leroy E. Nelson—directed his 3rd Battalion to lead the American assault on the first of several hills, followed by the regiment's 1st Battalion. Artillery support was provided by [[M101 howitzer|105 mm howitzers]] from the U.S. Army's 246th Field Artillery Battalion and the [[M116 howitzer|75 mm pack howitzers]] of the [[2nd Battalion, 10th Marines]].<ref>Miller, pp. 237–238; Frank, p. 530; Jersey, pp. 350–351. The 132nd's 1st Battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Earl F. Ripstra.</ref>

The exposed hills making up the Mount Austen complex were arbitrarily numbered by the Americans for reference purposes (see map at right). On 17 December, Nelson's 3rd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William C. Wright—advanced south of Hill 35 and began to climb toward Mount Austen's summit near Hills 20 and 21. In order to achieve its timetable set by the division commander, the battalion was forced to leave behind many of its support weapons, such as heavy mortars and machine guns, and to take only limited quantities of ammunition and supplies, all of which had to be hand-carried along hacked-out paths through thick jungle. At 09:30 on 18 December, as Wright's lead elements approached, Japanese defenders pinned down the Americans with machine-gun and rifle fire. Exhausted and dehydrated by their trek through the thick jungle, Wright's troops—unable to deploy quickly out of column formation—made no headway against the Japanese defenses.<ref>Frank, p. 530; Miller, pp. 238–239; Griffith, p. 265.</ref>

The next morning, after an artillery barrage and air strike from the CAF, Wright went forward with several artillery observers to investigate the terrain in front of his forces. Using concealed fire lanes, a Japanese machine-gun team killed Wright with a burst of fire at 09:30. Wright's second in command, Major Louis Franco, was unable to get forward and take command until late in the day, preventing the battalion from continuing the attack. At the same time, Japanese riflemen infiltrated the American positions and effectively harassed the command posts of both the 3rd and 1st Battalions as well as the column of heavily loaded American supply and engineer parties on the hacked-out jungle trail linking the battalions with the Lunga perimeter. Both U.S. battalions dug in for the night while artillery bombarded the Japanese positions.<ref>Miller, pp. 239–240; Frank, pp. 530–531; Jersey, p. 354; Zimmerman, p. 158.</ref>

[[File:GuadGifuJapaneseBunker.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Japanese pillboxes that made up the Gifu position]]
Between 20 and 23 December, the Japanese apparently withdrew from the area, as aggressive U.S. Army patrols encountered no more enemy in the area of Hills 20 and 21 and further to the south. Nelson ordered the two battalions to move west to Hill 31 and then attack south towards Hill 27. On 24 December, the 3rd Battalion was halted on the slopes of Hill 31 by intense machine-gun fire from well-concealed positions.<ref>Miller, pp. 237, 240–244; Frank, pp. 531, 749; Rottman, p. 64; Jersey, p. 355.</ref>

Facing the Americans was the most strongly fortified Japanese position on Guadalcanal, nicknamed the ''Gifu'' (after [[Gifu Prefecture]] in Japan) by the Japanese. The Gifu position sat between the summits of Mount Austen and Hills 27 and 31 and consisted of a {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} line of 45–50 interconnected, mutually supporting, well-camouflaged [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] dug into the ground and forming a horseshoe shape with the open end to the west. Only about {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} of each pillbox was above ground with walls and roofs, constructed from logs and dirt, up to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick. Each pillbox contained one to two machine guns and several riflemen; some were sited underneath huge jungle trees. Each of these pillbox emplacements was sited to provide mutual support to the others. Numerous foxholes and trenches provided additional support and cover for additional riflemen and machine-gunners. Behind the pillboxes, the Japanese had sited 81&nbsp;mm and long-range [[Type 94 90 mm Infantry Mortar|90mm mortars]].<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;368–369: the Japanese 90 mm mortar was in effect a small field piece, firing a heavy projectile to ranges of up to 4000&nbsp;yards with extreme accuracy due to its especially stable mount.</ref> The Gifu was commanded by Major Takeyoshi Inagaki with around 800 men from the 2nd Battalion, 228th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry.<ref>Miller, pp. 237, 240–244; Frank, pp. 531, 749; Jersey, pp. 304, 344, 351–352, 360–362; Anderson. Jersey states that the Gifu was named by soldiers from the 230th Infantry Regiment who were from Gifu Prefecture, some units of which were helping defend the nearby Mount Austen area. The Gifu fortifications and layout had been designed by four experienced 17th Army fortification engineers, Lieutenant Colonel Makoto Hamada, Majors Shigemaichi Shida and Tsuneichi Shima, and Captain Masaru Tokuda. The position's personnel may have also included 28 [[Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces]] troops from the original Guadalcanal naval garrison. Inagaki's command post was located {{convert|400|yd|m}} northeast of Hill 27. The 2nd Company, 228th Machine-Gun Unit was also apparently assisting in the defense of the Gifu and nearby hills.</ref>

Between 25 and 29 December, the Japanese defenders prevented the Americans from making any headway in their attempt to overrun the Gifu position. While the U.S. 3rd Battalion—with artillery support—conducted frontal attacks against the position to pin the defenders, the U.S. 1st Battalion attempted to [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] the Gifu on the east. However, as the Japanese defenses were fully integrated, the flanking attempt was unsuccessful. By 29 December, U.S. losses had reached 53 killed, 129 wounded, and 131 sick,<ref>Frank, p. 532; Miller, pp. 244–246; Jersey, pp. 356–358; Griffith, p. 266.</ref> though morale remained high. Assisting the Americans in this battle were Fijian [[commando]]s led by officers and non-commissioned officers from the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]].<ref>''Shots Fired in Anger'', pp. 108, 112, 116–118: Second Lieutenant John George (no relation to Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. George) was with the 2nd Battalion which later took Hill 27. After a tour of the 132nd's lines and interviews with officers and men, he observed that although tired and low on rifle ammunition and grenades, the troops remained alert and eager for additional supplies to resume the battle.</ref>
[[File:GuadGifuJan2.gif|thumb|right|U.S. actions around the Gifu on 2&nbsp;January]]

On 2 January, Nelson added his 2nd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George F. Ferry—to the offensive and sent them on a march around the Gifu toward Hill 27. The battalion reached the lower slopes of the hill by 16:00 without meeting serious resistance from the Japanese. This same day, Nelson—who was physically and mentally exhausted and may have been suffering from malaria—was replaced as commander of the 132nd by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. George.<ref name="Frank, p p. 266">Frank, pp. 532–533, 750; Miller, pp. 237–238, 246–249; Jersey, p. 359; Griffith, p. 266</ref> Sources are unclear whether he requested his own relief or was ordered to relinquish command.<ref name="Frank, p p. 266"/>

The next day, elements of the 132nd's 2nd Battalion occupied the summit of Hill 27, surprised and killed a Japanese 75&nbsp;mm artillery crew, and successfully repulsed, with help from heavy artillery fire, six Japanese counterattacks on their positions. By this time, the soldiers atop Hill 27 were running extremely short of ammunition and grenades, with Japanese forces returning ten shots to each one fired by the Americans, and medical supplies were exhausted.<ref>George, pp. 102, 106–108</ref> The 2nd's efforts to improve its position were made more difficult by the hard coral underneath the hill's sod, which made the digging of foxholes difficult. The remainder of the 2nd Battalion, carrying ammunition, food, and medical supplies, reached Hill 27 and joined the battle, where they soon gained combat superiority over the attacking Japanese.<ref>George, pp. 94, 110–112.</ref> At the same time, with the infusion of new leadership by Lieutenant Colonel George, the 1st and 3rd Battalions attacked and pushed a short way into the Gifu, killing 25 Japanese in the process, then closed the gaps between their units and consolidated their positions, while killing many of the Japanese defenders. One officer from the 2nd Battalion, who had brought his personal sniper rifle to the battle, witnessed the final disintegration of Japanese units attacking Hill 27 with a final flurry of suicidal frontal charges.<ref>George, p.&nbsp;120–127.</ref> The Japanese soldiers in the Gifu, who had apparently not been resupplied or replenished during the battle, consumed their last remaining food rations on 1&nbsp;January.<ref>Miller, pp. 244, 249–252; Frank, pp. 533–534.</ref>

Since the beginning of its offensive on Mount Austen, the 132nd had lost 115 killed and 272 wounded. The relatively high number of combat deaths were caused in part by wound infections in the tropical conditions and inability to evacuate men wounded in the early stages of the operation.<ref>George, p. 106: The 'aid station' on Hill 27 consisted of one doctor, two aid men, two stretchers, half a dozen blankets, and a small kit of medicine and bandages.</ref> Even after intervention by the 2nd Battalion, wounded men continued to die, unable to withstand the arduous and slippery portage back down improvised jungle trails on a stretcher carried by two men. These losses, plus the effects of tropical diseases, heat, and combat exhaustion, temporarily rendered the 132nd's 1st and 3rd Battalions incapable of further offensive action. Thus, on 4&nbsp;January, the 1st and 3rd Battalions were ordered to dig in and hold positions surrounding the Gifu on the north, east, and south.<ref>Miller, pp. 244, 249–252; Frank, pp. 533–534; Jersey, pp. 360, 363.</ref>

Reviewing the first Mount Austen offensive, Marine officer and historian [[Samuel B. Griffith]] concludes, "As the thoroughly butchered Mount Austen operation dragged on into January, it became apparent that both Major General Patch and his assistant Division commander [Brigadier General [[Edmund Sebree]]] had much to unlearn, and perhaps even more to learn."<ref>Griffith, p. 267.</ref> However, while Patch's decision to attack Mount Austen was criticized, one participant noted the difficulties faced by the 132nd Regiment and its commanders, including the terrain, limited equipment (light mortars and machine guns with limited ammunition supply, no flamethrowers or pole charges), and the necessity of assaulting thoroughly integrated, prepared, and roofed-over Japanese defenses, which resisted direct hits by 75&nbsp;mm and in some cases 105&nbsp;mm shells.<ref>George, pp.&nbsp;315–322: In addition to being roofed-over and camouflaged, many of the Japanese positions were protected from direct assault by supporting fires from riflemen and light machine guns, and immune to all but direct hits by delayed-action shells from large-caliber guns or howitzers. Even the latter method was ineffective against some Japanese positions which were sited behind or underneath huge jungle trees.</ref> For its part, once the 132nd was able to treat its wounded, morale remained high in the newly blooded regiment, which played a significant role in later combat operations on Guadalcanal.<ref>George, pp. 106, 112, 116–117, 120–127</ref> The 2nd Battalion, with just 27 killed, was immediately assigned to further offensive combat operations.<ref>George, p. 131: "General Sebree told us our success in the Mount Austen (Hill 27) battle had been taken into account in the selection [of the 2nd Battalion for the next offensive]."</ref>

Losses among the Gifu defenders are unknown but were estimated by one 2nd Battalion officer as of 9&nbsp;January 1943 at 500 killed and wounded; most of the latter would later die of their wounds when combined with illness and starvation.<ref>George, pp. 128, 162: Nearly all of the Japanese soldiers wounded in the Mount Austen battle, starving and left without medical care, later died; for weeks afterwards, their unburied or half-interred bodies were encountered by U.S. troops.</ref> A Japanese officer's recovered diary stated that the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties. Japanese prisoners captured in later operations referred to the combat at Hills 27 and 31 as ''The Battle of the Mountain of Blood''.<ref>George, p. 128</ref>

===Arrival of American reinforcements===
On 2 January, with the arrival of the U.S. Army's 25th Division and the rest of the U.S. Marine 2nd Division, all of the American units on Guadalcanal and Tulagi were together designated as the [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] with Patch in command. Sebree took over as commander of the Americal Division. On 5&nbsp;January, Patch issued his plan to begin operations to clear Guadalcanal of Japanese forces. The 2nd Marine Division was to push westward from the Matanikau River along the coast while the 25th Division was to finish clearing Mount Austen and to secure the hilltops and ridges located around the inland forks of the Matanikau. The Americal Division and the [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry Regiment]] would guard the Lunga perimeter.<ref>Frank, pp. 550–552; Miller, pp. 254–255; Anderson; Hough, pp. 362, 366; Shaw, p. 49; Zimmerman, p. 159; Jersey, p. 365; Griffith, p. 270.</ref>
[[File:GuadMatanikauJanPlan.gif|thumb|left|Map of the Matanikau River area showing Japanese (red) and American (blue) positions and the American plan of attack along the coast and into the inland hills]]

The deep river ravines of the Matanikau's upper forks naturally divided the U.S. 25th Division's operations area into three distinct areas, with one main terrain feature dominating each area. East of the Matanikau was Mount Austen. In the wedge between the southeast and southwest forks of the Matanikau Hills 44 and 43 together formed a terrain feature that the Americans called the "Sea Horse", because of its shape when viewed from above. Between the Matanikau's southwest and northwest forks was a much larger hill mass labelled, also because of its shape, the "Galloping Horse".<ref>Frank, p. 552; Miller, pp. 257, 281.</ref>

Major General [[J. Lawton Collins]]—commander of the 25th Division—assigned his [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]] to clear the Gifu, secure the rest of Mount Austen, and to capture the Sea Horse. He ordered the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment]] to seize the Galloping Horse from the north. The 35th and the 27th were then to link up on Hill 53 (the Galloping Horse's "Head") to finish clearing the nearby hills and ridges. Collins placed his [[161st Infantry Regiment (United States)|161st Infantry Regiment]] in reserve. Ammunition and supplies for the attacking troops would be transported along rough jeep trails as far forward as possible and then carried the rest of the way by native Solomon Islanders.<ref>Frank, p. 552; Miller, pp. 255–257, 262; Anderson; Griffith, p. 271.</ref>

Having observed the arrival of the American reinforcements to the island, the Japanese were expecting the offensive. Hyakutake ordered the units on the hilltops around the Matanikau and in the Gifu to hold in place in their prepared positions. The Japanese hoped that as the Americans surrounded and intermingled with the Japanese defensive pockets that the close quarters fighting would prevent the Americans from employing their superior firepower in artillery and close air support. At night, the Japanese planned to infiltrate the American rear areas and interdict their supply lines to prevent the American assault forces from receiving sufficient ammunition and provisions to continue their attacks. The Japanese hoped to delay the Americans long enough for more reinforcements to arrive from Rabaul or elsewhere.<ref>Frank, p. 553.</ref>

===Galloping Horse===
[[File:GuadMatanikauGHJan10.gif|thumb|right|Map of the initial American attacks on the Galloping Horse, 10 January]]
[[File:GuadMatanikauGHJan12-13.gif|thumb|right|Map of the American attacks on the Galloping Horse, 12–13 January]]

Viewed from overhead with north upward, the Galloping Horse ridge appeared upside down, with Hills 54 and 55 forming the horse's rear legs, and Hill 57 forming the front legs. From east to west, Hills 50, 51, and 52 formed the horse's body with the {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} high Hill 53 at the head. Colonel William A. McCulloch—commander of the 27th Regiment—ordered his 1st Battalion to attack Hill 57 and his 3rd Battalion to assault Hills 51 and 52 from Hill 54, which was already in American hands. Defending the Galloping Horse and the nearby fork of the Matanikau were 600 Japanese soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment under Major Haruka Nishiyama.<ref>Frank, pp. 553, 567; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 261–262; Jersey, pp. 304, 344–345, 356; Anderson. Nishiyama's troops also manned the nearby Hills 49 (called ''Inu'' or "Dog" by the Japanese) and 67 (called ''Saru'' or "Monkey" by the Japanese).</ref>

The American attack commenced at 05:50 on 10 January with a [[bombardment]] by six battalions of artillery and airstrikes by 24 CAF aircraft on suspected Japanese positions in the valley between Hill 57 and the jumping-off point for the 1st Battalion. Beginning their advance at 07:30, the 1st Battalion successfully gained the summit of Hill 57 by 11:40 against light resistance.<ref>Frank, pp. 553–554; Miller, pp. 262–265; Griffith, p. 274.</ref>

From Hill 54, the 3rd Battalion's attack route was in the open and dominated by the high ground of Hills 52 and 53. At 06:35, the battalion commenced its assault and occupied Hill 51 without resistance. Continuing its advance, the battalion was stopped by heavy Japanese machine-gun fire {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} short of Hill 52's summit. After an airstrike by six CAF aircraft on Hill 52 and an artillery bombardment, the 3rd Battalion resumed their attack and successfully captured the summit by 16:25, destroying six machine gun positions and killing about 30 Japanese on the hill.<ref>Frank, p. 554; Miller, pp. 265–270.</ref>

At 09:00 on 11 January, the 3rd Battalion began its attack on Hill 53. The Japanese quickly stopped the American advance with machine-gun and mortar fire. The Americans—who had not received adequate replenishment in water—began to suffer extensive heat casualties. In one platoon, only ten men remained conscious by the afternoon.<ref>Frank, pp. 554–555; Miller, pp. 270–272; Griffith, pp. 274–275.</ref>

The next day, the 27th's 2nd Battalion took over the assault on Hill 53. Advancing up the hill, the Americans were stopped short of Hill 53's summit. During the night, Japanese infiltrators cut the telephone line between the 2nd Battalion and its regimental headquarters, affecting unit communications. On 13 January, the Americans renewed the attack but were again halted by heavy Japanese machine-gun and mortar fire.<ref>Frank, p. 555; Miller, pp. 272–275.</ref>

A knoll on the south edge of the ridge (the "horse's neck") leading to Hill 53 was the fulcrum of the Japanese defenses. The knoll contained several machine gun and mortar positions which had effectively held off the American attacks across the ridge. The 2nd Battalion's executive officer—Captain [[Charles W. Davis]]—volunteered to lead four other men against the knoll. Crawling on their bellies, Davis and his party crept to within {{convert|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the enemy position. The Japanese defenders threw two grenades at them, but the grenades failed to explode. Davis and his men threw eight grenades at the Japanese, destroying several of their positions. Davis then stood up, and while shooting his rifle, then pistol with one hand, waved his men forward with the other as he advanced further onto the knoll. Davis and his men then killed or chased away the rest of the Japanese on the knoll. Silhouetted against the sky during the action, Davis was visible to the Americans all up and down the ridge. Inspired by his actions, plus replenished with water by a sudden thunderstorm, the American troops "came to life" and quickly assaulted and captured Hill 53 by noon. The Americans counted the bodies of 170 Japanese soldiers on and around the Galloping Horse. The Americans suffered fewer than 100 killed.<ref>Frank, pp. 555–558; Miller, pp. 270, 275–276; Anderson; Jersey, pp. 367–368; Griffith, pp. 275–276.</ref>

Between 15 and 22 January, the 161st Infantry Regiment hunted the remainder of Nishiyama's battalion in the nearby gorge of the southwest Matanikau fork. In total, 400 Japanese were killed defending the Galloping Horse and surrounding area. Two hundred Japanese survivors, including Nishiyama, escaped to friendly lines on 19 January.<ref>Frank, pp. 555–558; Miller, pp. 270, 276–278. Exact American casualties from the Galloping Horse battle aren't recorded but the 27th Regiment lost a total of 74 killed and 226 wounded for the entire month of January 1943.</ref>

===Sea Horse===
The Sea Horse consisted of two hills, Hill 43 on the south with Hill 44 adjoining to the north.<ref>Frank, p. 562; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 281–283, 286; Jersey, pp. 360–361, 366–367. The Japanese 1st Battalion, 124th was commanded by Major Yukichi Kokusho until 2&nbsp;January when he was killed in action. Major Megumi Ishido then took command of the battalion. Some historians state that Kokusho was actually killed during the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]] on 13–14 September 1942. Jersey records that assisting the 124th were elements of the 38th Engineer Regiment and 1st Battalion, 229th Regiment, plus a company from the 230th Regiment. Jersey, however, isn't clear as to where exactly these units were positioned, whether near the Gifu or closer to the Sea Horse. The 3rd Company, 38th Engineer Regiment in the Sea Horse area was commanded by Captain Kiyoshi Saito. The 2nd Company, 230th Regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Mano Tamotsu. The 1st Battalion, 229th Regiment was commanded by Major Tsuguto Tomoda after its original commander, Major Sugura Orita was wounded in action.</ref> Viewed from overhead with north upward, the Sea Horse ridge appeared upside down, with Hill 43 forming the seahorse's head and Hill 44 forming the abdomen. The American 35th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Robert B. McClure, was assigned to capture the Sea Horse and complete the reduction of the Gifu on Mount Austen. McClure assigned his 2nd Battalion to the assault on the Gifu and sent his 1st and 3rd Battalions on a long march through the jungle to attack the Sea Horse from the south. Defending the Sea Horse and nearby valleys were the Japanese 124th Regiment's 1st and 3rd Battalions, with Oka's command post located nearby. 
[[File:GuadSeahorseJan8-11.gif|thumb|left|The American march to and assault on the Sea Horse (left)]]

After taking a {{convert|7000|yd|m|abbr=on}} circuitous route through the jungle around Mount Austen, at 06:35 on 10 January, McClure's 3rd Battalion launched its attack on Hill 43. As the Americans closed on Hill 43 from the south, a group of Japanese soldiers near Oka's command post spotted the U.S. soldiers as they crossed a stream and attacked immediately, threatening the flank of the American column. Two American soldiers—[[William G. Fournier]] and [[Lewis Hall (soldier)|Lewis Hall]]—successfully repelled the Japanese attack with a machine gun but were killed in the process. Making progress against light resistance, the 3rd Battalion dug in for the night about {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=on}} short of Hill 43's summit.<ref>Frank, pp. 562–563; Miller, pp. 281–283, 286–287; Anderson; Jersey, p. 366.</ref>

The next day, the 1st Battalion of the 35th was added to the attack, and the two units—with artillery support—drove through several Japanese machine-gun positions and took Hill 43 by early afternoon. Continuing on towards Hill 44 against light opposition, the Americans captured the rest of the Sea Horse by nightfall, cutting off Japanese forces in the Gifu. The native Solomon Islanders who had been man-packing supplies to the two American battalions during the attack were having difficulty delivering sufficient food and ammunition over the long trail between the Sea Horse and the Lunga perimeter. Thus, [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[heavy bomber]]s were used to air drop supplies to the American troops around the Sea Horse.<ref>Frank, pp. 562–563; Miller, pp. 281–283, 287–289; Anderson; Jersey, p. 367.</ref>

On 12 January, the two American battalions of the 35th continued their attack to the west toward the Galloping Horse but were stopped by a Japanese strongpoint on a narrow ridge about {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} west of their point of departure. After trying to flank the position for two days, the Americans were able to smash the strongpoint with mortar and artillery fire, killing 13 Japanese defenders, and they advanced to a ridge overlooking the southwest fork of the Matanikau by 15:00 on 15 January. That same day, Japanese survivors from the Sea Horse battle—including Oka and most of the 124th's headquarters staff section and the 1st Battalion—were able to slip past the American forces and reach friendly lines further west. The Americans counted 558 Japanese dead around the Sea Horse, mostly from the 124th's 3rd Battalion, and captured 17.<ref>Frank, pp. 562–563; Miller, pp. 289–290, 296; Jersey, pp. 361, 372. Miller states that the Japanese strongpoint was {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} west of the Sea Horse, not {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} as Frank claims. Jersey notes that the Japanese defenders of the ridge strongpoint may have been from the 3rd Battalion, 230th Regiment commanded by Major Ampei Onada. Jersey claims that Oka was killed during the Ke evacuation (Jersey, pp. 371–372).</ref>

===Second Mount Austen===
On 9 January, McClure's 2nd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Peters—replaced the three battalions from the 132nd Regiment and prepared to assault the Gifu. Over the next four days, the Americans tried to feel out the Japanese positions with patrols. At the same time, the Gifu defenders attempted to wear down the Americans with night infiltration attacks. By 13 January, the 2nd Battalion had lost 57 killed or wounded. The battle casualties plus malaria reduced the battalion to 75% of its effective strength by the next day. To assist the battalion, the 35th Regiment's anti-tank gun company personnel were attached to the battalion as infantry.<ref>Frank, pp. 563–564; Miller, pp. 290–294.</ref>
[[File:Guad25thWouded.jpg|thumb|left|An injured American soldier from the 35th Infantry Regiment is prepared for evacuation from the battle area on 15 January.]]

With the capture of the Sea Horse by the Americans, the Japanese in the Gifu were isolated from the rest of the 17th Army. In a last message over his field phone before the line was cut, Inagaki refused an order from Oka to abandon his position and attempt to infiltrate back to friendly lines, instead vowing that his command would "fight to the last". Inagaki apparently refused the order because to do so would have meant leaving his sick and injured men behind.<ref>Frank, p. 564; Miller, p. 296; Griffith, p. 278.</ref>

An American attack on the Gifu by the entire 2nd Battalion on 15 January was completely repulsed by the Japanese. In response, McClure relieved Peters of command on 16 January and replaced him with Major [[Stanley R. Larsen]]. Larsen decided to completely surround the Gifu and try to reduce it with a massive artillery bombardment on 17 January.<ref>Frank, pp. 564–565; Miller, pp. 295–298; Anderson; Jersey, pp. 367–369. Jersey says Peters was relieved for, "not implementing an order" (Jersey p. 367).</ref>

In the meantime, the Americans used a loudspeaker to broadcast a surrender appeal in Japanese to the Gifu's defenders. Only five Japanese soldiers responded. One of the five reported that his company actually gathered to discuss the appeal but decided not to surrender because they were too weak to carry their injured, non-ambulatory comrades with them to the American lines. Instead, they elected to perish together as a unit. One Japanese officer defending the Gifu wrote in his diary, "I heard the enemy talking in Japanese over a loud speaker. He is probably telling us to come out—what fools the enemy are. The Japanese Army will stick it out to the end. Position must be defended in all conditions with our lives."<ref>Frank, p. 565; Miller, pp. 298–299; Jersey, p. 369.</ref>

At 14:30 on 17 January, twelve [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]] and thirty-seven 105&nbsp;mm guns opened fire on the Gifu. Over the next one and a half hours, the American artillery fired 1,700 shells into an area about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} square. Because of the lateness of the hour, the Americans were unable to follow the barrage with an immediate attack but instead had to wait until the next day, which allowed the Japanese time to recover. On 18 January, the Americans attacked into the weaker west side of the Gifu, making some headway and destroying several Japanese pillboxes over the next two days until heavy rain stopped the attack on 20 January. That night, eleven Japanese were killed trying to escape from the Gifu.<ref>Frank, pp. 565–566; Miller, pp. 298–303. The U.S. artillery units involved included the 105-mm howitzers of the 88th Field Artillery Battalion, one 105-mm howitzer of the 8th, and the 155-mm howitzers of the 90th and 221st Field Artillery Battalions in addition to the 105-mm. howitzers of the 64th Field Artillery Battalion.</ref>
[[File:GuadGifuJan22-23.gif|thumb|right|Tank support cracks the Gifu for American forces]]

On 22 January, the Americans were able to move a [[Stuart tank|light tank]] up their supply trail to Mount Austen. The tank proved to be the decisive factor in the battle. At 10:20, the tank—protected by 16–18 riflemen—blasted three Japanese pillboxes and penetrated into the Gifu pocket. Proceeding onward, the tank completely traversed the Gifu and destroyed five more pillboxes, breaching a gap {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide in the Japanese line. The American infantry surged through the gap and took positions in the middle of the Gifu.<ref>Frank, p. 566; Miller p. 303; Anderson; Jersey, p. 370; Gilbert, pp. 50–51. The tank was commanded by Captain Theodore Deese and crewed by men from the 25th Division Reconnaissance Troop. Three tanks, formerly belonging to Marine units on Guadalcanal, actually moved up to Mount Austen, but two were disabled in the process and were unable to participate in the attack.</ref>

That night around 02:30 on 23 January, apparently realizing the battle was lost, Inagaki led his staff and most of the remaining survivors of his command—about 100 men—in a final charge on the Americans. In the charge, Inagaki and the remainder of his troops were killed almost to the last man. At sunrise, the Americans secured the rest of the Gifu. Sixty-four men from the American 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry were killed during the assaults on the Gifu between 9&nbsp;and 23 January, bringing the total number of Americans killed taking Mount Austen to 175. The Americans counted the bodies of 431 Japanese in the remains of the Gifu's fortifications and 87 elsewhere around Mount Austen. Total Japanese losses in the Sea Horse and both Mount Austen battles were probably between 1,100 and 1,500 men.<ref>Frank, pp. 566–567; Miller, pp. 303–305; Anderson; Jersey, p. 371. Also killed in the final Japanese charge was Major Nishihata, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment.</ref>

===Coastal drive===
At the same time that the U.S. Army offensive was taking place in the hills around the upper Matanikau, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division—under the command of Brigadier General [[Alphonse DeCarre]]—was attacking along the north coast of Guadalcanal. Facing the Marines in the hills and ravines south of Point Cruz were the remains of the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Masao Maruyama (Japanese Army officer)|Masao Maruyama]], plus the 1st Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment from the 38th Infantry Division under Major Kikuo Hayakawa.<ref>Frank, p. 556; Miller, pp. 278–279; Jersey, pp. 304, 344–345, 356, 361; Hough, pp. 363–364. Jersey states that the 228th Regiment's command post was also located in this area but doesn't say if this post included Major General Takeo Ito or just the regimental commander, Doi and/or Suemura. The 228th's 1st Battalion was located on Hills 75, 78, and 80, called ''Sakai Dai'' or "Skyline Ridge" by the Japanese.</ref>
[[File:GuadMatanikauJan13-18.gif|thumb|left|U.S. Marine drive along the coast]]

On 13 January, the [[2nd Marine Regiment|2nd]] and [[8th Marine Regiment|8th]] Marine regiments began their offensive with the 8th Marines attacking along the coast and the 2nd Marines advancing further inland. The Japanese were pushed back in some places but held in others, with heavy fighting occurring at several locations in the hills and ravines near the coast. On 14 January, the 2nd Marines were relieved by the [[6th Marine Regiment]] under the command of Colonel [[Gilder D. Jackson Jr.|Gilder D. Jackson]].<ref>Frank, pp. 556–557; Miller, pp. 278–279; Hough, p. 365; Shaw, pp. 49–50; Zimmerman, pp. 159–160, 164; Jersey, pp. 364, 366. The 6th Marines were commanded by Colonel Gilder D. Jackson.</ref>

The Marines renewed the offensive on 15 January. The Japanese stymied the 8th Marines' advance along the coast. Inland, however, the 6th Marines were able to successfully advance about {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} and threatened the flank of the Japanese forces emplaced in front of the 8th Marines. At 17:00, Maruyama ordered his troops to retreat to a pre-coordinated line about {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}} to the west.<ref>Frank, p. 557; Miller, p. 279; Hough pp. 365–366; Jersey, pp. 364–365. The Marines used a flamethrower, captured earlier from the Japanese, in combat for the first time this day, destroying three Japanese emplacements.</ref>

Early on 16 January, as many of Maruyama's men attempted to comply with the order to retreat, the 6th Marines turned and drove to the coast, trapping most of Maruyama's 4th and 16th Regiments between themselves and the 8th Marines. By 14:00 on 17 January, the Marines had destroyed the Japanese forces trapped in the pocket, killing 643 and capturing two.<ref>Frank, pp. 557–558; Miller, p. 279; Hough, p. 367; Jersey, p. 369.</ref>

==Aftermath==
On 15 January, an IJA representative from Rabaul reached Guadalcanal on a Tokyo Express mission and informed Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw Japanese forces from the island. Grudgingly accepting the order, the 17th Army staff communicated the [[Operation Ke|''Ke'' evacuation plan]] to their forces on 18 January. The plan directed the 38th Division to disengage and withdraw towards [[Cape Esperance]] on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on 20 January. The 38th's retirement would be covered by the 2nd Division and other units, which would then follow the 38th westward. Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to "uphold the honor of the Imperial Army". From Cape Esperance the Japanese navy planned to evacuate the army forces over the last few days of January and first week of February with a projected completion date of the evacuation of 10 February.<ref>Frank, pp. 541, 562; Miller, p. 349; Jersey, p. 368; Griffith, pp. 279–284.</ref>
[[File:GuadKokumbonaJan23-25.gif|thumb|right|American advance westward, 23–25 January]]

The U.S. and its Allies mistook Japanese preparations for ''Ke'' as another reinforcement attempt. With this in mind, Patch ordered his forces to launch another offensive against the Japanese forces west of the Matanikau. On 21 January, the 27th and 161st Regiments pushed westward from the area of the Galloping Horse. The Americans—unaware that the 38th Division was withdrawing in preparation to evacuate the island—were surprised to encounter light resistance. Advancing more quickly through the inland hills and ridges than the Japanese had anticipated, by 22 January the Americans were in position to capture Kokumbona on the coast, headquarters of the 17th Army, and completely cut off the remainder of the 2nd Division.<ref>Frank, pp. 546, 568–570; Miller, pp. 319–329. On 22 January, Colonel [[James Dalton II]] relieved Colonel [[Clarence Orndorff]]—who was ill with malaria—as commander of the 161st (Miller, p. 346).</ref>

Reacting quickly to the situation, the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.<ref>Frank, p. 570; Miller, pp. 329–332.</ref>

Over the next week, the Japanese rear-guard—assisted by difficult terrain—effectively delayed the American advance westward from Kokumbona. General Patch—still believing that a Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent—kept most of his forces back to guard Henderson Field, sending only one regiment at a time to continue the advance. Thus, the majority of the surviving Japanese army forces was able to gather at Cape Esperance by the end of January. On 1, 4, and 7&nbsp;February, Japanese warships successfully evacuated 10,652 army troops from the island. On 9&nbsp;February, the Americans discovered that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure.<ref>Frank, pp. 571–572, 582–597; Miller, pp. 332–335, 338–349; Zimmerman, p. 164.</ref>

In hindsight, some historians have faulted the Americans—especially Patch and Admiral [[William Halsey]], commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific—for not taking advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Halsey had been recently repulsed at the [[Battle of Rennell Island]]. Patch and Harmon's insistence on taking Mount Austen has been cited as one of the factors that delayed the American's main attack to the west, giving the 17th Army a chance to escape. Said [[Merrill B. Twining]] of the Japanese forces deployed on and around Mount Austen, "Theoretically these Japanese did offer a threat to our major force advancing westward along the coast, but as a practical matter these isolated groups were composed of sick and starving men unable to do anything more than die in place. Under the circumstances disclosed by subsequent events, it is obvious that Mt. Austen was just part of the scenery and of no significant import to either of the antagonists."<ref>Frank, p. 597; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 348–350; Twining, p. 165.</ref>

Nevertheless, the larger successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the end of World War II.<ref>Frank, p. 597; Rottman, p. 64; Miller, pp. 348–350.</ref>

The theory of computation concerns abstract [[models of computation]] and general classes of [[computational problem|problems]] that can be solved using them. The fields of [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]] involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing [[security vulnerabilities]]. [[Computer graphics (computer science)|Computer graphics]] and [[computational geometry]] address the generation of images. [[Programming language theory]] considers different ways to describe computational processes, and [[database]] theory concerns the management of repositories of data. [[Human–computer interaction]] investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as [[operating system]]s, [[Computer network|network]]s and [[embedded system]]s investigate the principles and design behind [[complex system]]s. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, [[computer vision]] aims to understand and process image and video data, while [[natural language processing]] aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the [[abacus]] have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. [[Algorithm]]s for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Computer Science |url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html#:~:text=In%20the%201960%27s,%20computer%20science,person%20to%20receive%20a%20Ph. |access-date=2022-07-15 |website=cs.uwaterloo.ca |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729210116/https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html#:~:text=In%20the%201960%27s,%20computer%20science,person%20to%20receive%20a%20Ph. |url-status=live }}</ref>

The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is [[data science]]; this is now used for a [[multi-disciplinary]] field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.

In the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested (albeit facetiously) in the ''Communications of the ACM''—''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied [[epistemologist]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |date=<!-- missing! --> |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=6| doi = 10.1145/368796.368802|last1=Weiss |first1=E.A. |title=Letters to the editor |journal= Communications of the ACM |last2=Corley |first2=Henry P.T. |s2cid=5379449 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.<ref>Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4</ref> The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.<ref>IEEE Computer 28(12): p.136</ref> {{anchor|Name of the field in Europe}}In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "{{lang|it|informazione automatica}}" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g. {{lang|fr|informatique}} (French), {{lang|de|Informatik}} (German), {{lang|it|informatica}} (Italian, Dutch), {{lang|es|informática}} (Spanish, Portuguese), {{lang|sla|informatika}} ([[Slavic languages]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or {{lang|el-latn|pliroforiki}} ({{lang|el|πληροφορική|italic=no}}, which means informatics) in [[Greek language|Greek]].

A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—[[Edsger Dijkstra]], states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."<ref group=note>See the entry
"[[q:Computer science|Computer science]]" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.</ref> The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called information technology or [[information system]]s. However, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[Earth science]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.<ref name=Denning/> Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Alonzo Church]] and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].<ref name="Tedre2014"/>

The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Software engineering#Suitability|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tedre | first1 = M. | title = Computing as a Science: A Survey of Competing Viewpoints | doi = 10.1007/s11023-011-9240-4 | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–387 | year = 2011 | s2cid = 14263916 }}</ref> [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnas | first1 = D.L. | journal = Annals of Software Engineering | volume = 6 | pages = 19–37 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018949113292|title=Software engineering programmes are not computer science programmes| s2cid = 35786237 }}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [...]"</ref>

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

Nonetheless, they are experiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.<ref name = "plato"/>}} It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness of programs]], but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science.<ref name = "plato"/> Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in [[civil engineering]] and airplanes in [[aerospace engineering]].<ref name = "plato"/> They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.<ref name = "plato"/>

[[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]], formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE CS)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csab.org/ |title=CSAB Leading Computer Education |publisher=CSAB |date=August 3, 2011 |access-date=19 November 2011 |archive-date=January 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120190336/http://www.csab.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: ''theory of computation'', ''algorithms and data structures'', ''programming methodology and languages'', and ''computer elements and architecture''. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and [[symbolic computation]] as being important areas of computer science.<ref name="CSAB1997"/>

===Theoretical computer science===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
''Theoretical computer science'' is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.

====Theory of computation====

{{main|Theory of computation}}

According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be automated?"<ref name=DenningAutomated/> Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.

The famous [[P = NP?]] problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],<ref>[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P = NP {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> is an open problem in the theory of computation.

====Information and coding theory====

{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}

Information theory, closely related to [[probability]] and [[statistics]], is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by [[Claude Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 14, 2002 |last=P. Collins |first=Graham |title=Claude E. Shannon: Founder of Information Theory |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |work=Scientific American |access-date=December 12, 2014 |archive-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183558/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |url-status=live }}</ref>
Coding theory is the study of the properties of [[code]]s (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.

====Programming language theory and formal methods====
{{main|Programming language theory|Formal methods}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]]. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and [[linguistics]]. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of software and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems.<ref>Phillip A. Laplante, (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Software Engineering'' Three-Volume Set (Print). CRC Press. p. 309. {{ISBN|978-1-351-24926-3}}.</ref> The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

====Image and sound processing====
{{main|Data processing}}
[[Information]] can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. [[Bit]]s of information can be streamed via [[signal]]s. Its [[Data processing|processing]] is the central notion of informatics, the European view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier – whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. This field plays important role in [[information theory]], [[telecommunications]], [[information engineering]] and has applications in [[medical image computing]] and [[speech synthesis]], among others. ''What is the lower bound on the complexity of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms?'' is one of the [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problems in theoretical computer science]].

====Computational science, finance and engineering====
{{main|Computational science|Computational finance|Computational engineering}}
{{See also|List of computer-aided engineering software}}

[[Scientific computing]] (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[scientific]] problems. A major usage of scientific computing is [[simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,<ref>Muhammad H. Rashid, (2016). ''SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power''. CRC Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6047-2}}.</ref> as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for [[integrated circuit]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|title=What is an integrated circuit (IC)?

====Software engineering====
{{main|Software engineering}}
{{see also|Computer programming}}
Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance. For example [[software testing]], [[systems engineering]], [[technical debt]] and [[software development process]]es.

====Artificial intelligence====
{{main|Artificial intelligence|Bio-inspired computing}}

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], symbolic logic, [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing's question "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Can computers think?]]", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

====Computer architecture and microarchitecture====
{{main|Computer architecture|Microarchitecture|Computer engineering}}

Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.<ref>{{cite web|last=A. Thisted|first=Ronald|title=Computer Architecture |url=http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|publisher=The University of Chicago|date=April 7, 1997}}</ref> Computer engineers study [[computational logic]] and design of computer hardware, from individual [[Processor (computing)|processor]] components, [[microcontroller]]s, [[personal computer]]s to [[supercomputer]]s and [[embedded system]]s. The term "architecture" in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and [[Frederick P. Brooks Jr.]], members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959.

====Computer security and cryptography====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology with the objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.

Historical [[cryptography]] is the art of writing and deciphering secret messages. Modern cryptography is the scientific study of problems relating to distributed computations that can be attacked.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Katz|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137325053|title=Introduction to modern cryptography|date=2008|publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC|others=Yehuda Lindell|isbn=978-1-58488-551-1|location=Boca Raton|oclc=137325053|access-date=November 17, 2021|archive-date=May 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220506003141/http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137325053|url-status=live}}</ref> Technologies studied in modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric [[encryption]], [[digital signature]]s, [[cryptographic hash function]]s, [[key-agreement protocol]]s, [[blockchain]], [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, and [[garbled circuit]]s.

====Databases and data mining====
{{main|Database|Data mining}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s. Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets.

==Discoveries==
The philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last=Rapaport|first=William J.|date=20 September 2013|access-date=August 31, 2013|archive-date=February 14, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010214002845/http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".{{refn |group="note"|The word "anything" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}
:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
{{see also|Digital physics}}
* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:<ref>B. Jack Copeland, (2012). ''Alan Turing's Electronic Brain: The Struggle to Build the ACE, the World's Fastest Computer''. OUP Oxford. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960915-4}}.</ref>

{{see also|Turing machine}}
* [[Corrado Böhm]] and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only ''three ways of combining'' these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".<ref>Charles W. Herbert, (2010). ''An Introduction to Programming Using Alice 2.2''. Cengage Learning. p. 122. {{ISBN|0-538-47866-7}}.</ref>

:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
::*''sequence'': first do this, then do that;
::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.
:: The three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).
{{see also|Structured program theorem}}

==Programming paradigms==
{{main|Programming paradigm}}

Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:
* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.

* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, (2015). ''Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation''.

{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of [[conference papers]] is greater than that of journal publications.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Viewpoint: Research evaluation for computer science|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2009|volume=25|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1145/1498765.1498780|s2cid=8625066|url=https://pure.itu.dk/portal/da/publications/b474cea0-8288-11dd-b116-000ea68e967b }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=David|title=Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure|url=http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|publisher=Computing Research Association|date=August 1999|access-date=July 19, 2015|archive-date=July 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722020941/http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|url-status=live}}</ref> One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fortnow|first1=Lance|title=Viewpoint: Time for Computer Science to Grow Up|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=August 2009|volume=52|issue=8|pages=33–35|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536631|doi-access=free}}</ref>

'''John Silva Meehan''' (February 6, 1790 – April 24, 1863) was an American publisher, printer, and newspaper editor.  He served as the [[librarian of Congress]] from 1829 to 1861.

Born in New York City, Meehan worked as a printer in his youth. He briefly served in the [[U.S. Navy]] during the last few months of the [[War of 1812]]. He returned without seeing combat and began work as a publisher in [[Philadelphia]] alongside fellow printer Robert Anderson, publishing a [[Baptist]] religious journal. After the firm moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in early 1822, Meehan began editing and publishing the Baptist weekly newspaper ''The Columbian Star''. Leaving the ''Star'' in late 1825, Meehan nominally purchased the ''[[City of Washington Gazette]]'' on direction from [[Andrew Jackson]]'s presidential campaign, renaming the paper the ''United States' Telegraph'' and taking an immensely partisan stance. Jackson supporters considered Meehan unable to properly spearhead the press campaign. Control over the paper gradually shifted towards editor and publisher [[Duff Green]], with Meehan officially leaving the paper in October 1826; however, he continued to serve as Green's editorial assistant until 1829.

Following a purge of numerous incumbent officials in the aftermath of [[1828 United States presidential election|Jackson's 1828 election]], Meehan was appointed as librarian of Congress via the [[spoils system]] and with Green's urging, replacing the staunch anti-Jacksonian [[George Watterston]]. Meehan's tenure as librarian saw the steady growth of the [[Library of Congress]], collaborating with longstanding [[United States Congressional Joint Committee on the Library|Joint Committee on the Library]] chair [[James Pearce]] for most of his tenure. A large fire in December 1851 destroyed 35,000 of the library's 55,000 books. Meehan and Pearce oversaw the reconstruction of the library after the disaster, restocking it with substantial purchases of books and rebuilding the main hall. The [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860 prompted Meehan's removal in 1861 in favor of Indiana physician [[John Gould Stephenson]]. Largely unbothered by this, he retired gracefully and died suddenly in 1863. Both Stephenson and later historians were generally critical of Meehan's tenure, noting that he mainly deferred to the Joint Committee on library policy, leaving the library's archaic catalog system unchanged, and failing to make any progress in transforming the institution into a true [[national library]].

== Early life ==
John Silva Meehan was born in New York City on February 6, 1790. Little is recorded of his early life. He attended school in New York and later entered work as a printer. In 1811 or 1812, he moved to [[Burlington, New Jersey]], to work as a printer at Lexicon Press under publisher David Allinson. There, Meehan helped print Richard S. Coxe's ''New Critical Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language''. He met Margaret Jones Monington, from Burlington, and married her in 1814.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=3}}{{Sfn|Mearns|1947|p=36}}

[[File:USS Firefly 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|1857 depiction of the ''[[USS Firefly]]''|alt=A drawing of a ship in choppy seas]]

In January 1815, Meehan returned to New York to enlist in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. He served as a [[midshipman]] on the [[USS Firefly|USS ''Firefly'']] during the [[War of 1812]]. The ''Firefly'' was the flagship of a small group of commerce raiders in the [[West Indies]]. Shortly afterwards, the ratification of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] concluded the war. The ''Firefly'' did not see action, to the disappointment of Meehan and the rest of the crew. Leaving service in April 1815, he moved to [[Philadelphia]] and declined an offered [[Commission (document)|commission]] in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] to focus on his printing career. His first daughter, Susan, was born the same month.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=3–4}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|p=29}}

== Publishing career ==
[[File:Columbian Star October 22 1824 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Masthead of ''[[The Columbian Star]]'', October 23, 1824|alt=A newspaper masthead]]

In Philadelphia, Meehan partnered with fellow printer Robert Anderson to create the Anderson & Meehan firm. They began publishing the ''Latter Day Luminary'' in 1818, a Baptist General Conference-sponsored religious journal published five times a year. The firm moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in early 1822, and the ''Luminary'' was shifted to a monthly publication. In February 1822, soon after moving to Washington, Anderson & Meehan also began publishing ''[[The Columbian Star]]'', self-described as an apolitical Baptist weekly newspaper.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=3–4}}{{Sfn|Millington|1925|p=50}} The two served as the chief editors of the paper for about a year, before editorship was transferred to Reverend James D. Knowles.{{Sfn|Millington|1925|p=50}} Alongside the two regular publications, the firm would occasionally publish other items, such as pamphlets. Anderson left the ''Star'' in early 1823 and the ''Luminary'' by the end of that year, leaving Meehan as the sole publisher. Knowles left the ''Star'' in July 1825, making Meehan the editor of the paper. Six months later Meehan left the paper, seeking not to associate the largely apolitical ''Star'' with his entry into political writing. He transferred publication and editorship of the ''Star'' to [[Baron Stow]] and discontinued the ''Luminary''.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=3–4}}

=== ''United States' Telegraph'' ===
{{Main article|United States' Telegraph}}

Following his narrow loss in a House [[contingent election]] after the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], Tennessee senator [[Andrew Jackson]] and his former running mate [[John C. Calhoun]] sought a supportive newspaper in Washington, D.C.{{Sfn|Ewing|1978|p=128}} The Jackson campaign indirectly purchased [[Jonathan Elliot (publisher)|Jonathan Elliot]]'s ''[[City of Washington Gazette]]'' through allies [[William Berkeley Lewis|William B. Lewis]] and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]]. Although Meehan ostensibly purchased the paper, Eaton likely directed the purchase. Meehan served as the first publisher and chief editor of the paper, which was renamed the ''United States' Telegraph''. The newspaper entered publication on February 6, 1826.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|p=9}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=4}}{{Sfn|Mearns|1947|p=37}} The ''Telegraph'' was published in weekly, thrice-weekly, and daily editions, available by subscription. From the outset, the paper was immensely partisan, strongly opposed to the election of President [[John Quincy Adams]] and the appointment of Secretary of State [[Henry Clay]]. It declared that these violated "the most sacred principles of [[Constitution of the United States|the Constitution]]" due to the contingent election and adopted the motto "Power is always stealing from the many to the few."{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=4–5}}{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=81–82}}

As editor, Meehan heavily criticized the system of executive patronage (also known as the [[spoils system]]). He attacked the appointment of an anti-Jacksonian postmaster in Jackson's hometown of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], claiming the appointment was solely made to "mortify" Jackson.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=82–83}} Meehan also emphasized defending Jackson's reputation, describing him as an "abused citizen" and claiming that Jackson was above the political games and corruption that he attributed to the Adams administration. [[National Republican Party|National Republican]]-aligned newspapers began to oppose the ''Telegraph'', with ''[[The National Intelligencer]]'' and [[National Journal (newspaper)|''National Journal'']] claiming Meehan's editorials amounted to "indiscriminate opposition".{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=83–84}}

Soon after he acquired the paper, Jacksonians began to worry that Meehan lacked the ferocity and boldness needed to support the campaign. Although Meehan was recognized for his strong anti-Adams advocacy through the ''Telegraph'', the ownership of the paper grew uncomfortable with his perceived inability to mount an effective response against the administration. The lack of transparency around the formation of the ''Telegraph'' invited allegations of conspiracy. The ''[[Richmond Whig]]'' described the paper as "edited by nobody knows whom, supported, nobody knows how".{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=81–82}}

Missouri editor and politician [[Duff Green]] was summoned to Washington by prominent Jacksonians to take over the ''Telegraph''.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=26}} He published several editorials in the paper and offered to purchase it after strong rebuttals from the ''National Journal''. Green borrowed large amounts of money from Jacksonian politicians, including Eaton, to finance this purchase. An official deal between Meehan and Green was reached on June 5, 1826, purchasing the paper and its printing office.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=85–86}} Meehan was hired as Green's assistant for a three-year term. Green soon left to travel the country, and Meehan continued serving as the ''de facto'' chief editor of the paper for several months. During this period, Meehan clashed with the pro-administration press on several issues, including Adams' alleged purchase of a [[Billiard table|billiards table]] and the military significance of Jackson's victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]].{{Sfn|Smith|1981|pp=85–89}}

The last issue of the ''Telegraph'' featuring Meehan's name was published on October 17, 1826. No official statement was made regarding the change of ownership. While working as Green's publisher, Meehan additionally served as the secretary of the board of trustees of the Baptist [[George Washington University|Columbian College]].{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=5}}{{Sfn|Smith|1981|p=134}}

== Librarian of Congress ==
=== Appointment ===
Upon Jackson's election in 1828, the incoming administration began a mass shift of government positions in favor of supportive [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] via the [[spoils system]]. [[George Watterston]], the [[librarian of Congress]] since 1815, had strong connections to many of Jackson's opponents, including Henry Clay. Watterston was later described by historian [[David C. Mearns]] as having been a "librarian of one side of the aisle".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=107–109}}{{Sfn|Mearns|1947|p=36}} Jackson originally intended to replace Watterston with Charles P. Tutt, but Tutt declined in favor of a position as U.S. Navy Agent at [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=31–32}}

Green wrote to Andrew Jackson on April 23, 1829, recommending Meehan as Watterston's replacement for librarian of Congress. Green, in increasing amounts of debt, wished to hire an assistant editor at a lower rate than that agreed for Meehan.{{Sfn|Smith|1981|p=134}} Biographer Christian Nappo described the letter as significantly embellishing Meehan's scholarly capabilities and his appointment itself as "purely an act of political patronage".{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=31–32}}

}}

Meehan was officially appointed as librarian on May 28, 1829. Clay, angered by the appointment, compared Watterston's removal to the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]].{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}} The ''[[New-England Palladium]]'' condemned Watterston's removal but conceded that Meehan was ultimately "an amiable and respectable man" and preferable to other possible Jacksonian candidates.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=31–32}} The strongly anti-Jacksonian ''National Journal'' and Meehan's former ''United States' Telegraph'' extensively covered Meehan's appointment, debating the legality of the move. Jacksonian press attacked Watterston's character, describing him as pompous and impractical.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=107–109}}

Debates over the appointment also reflected broader attitudes towards the future of the library. Rather than simply providing for Congress, Watterston sought to transform the [[Library of Congress]] into a comprehensive [[national library]] aimed at the education of the general public, which Jacksonians feared would represent increased federal power. However, Jackson may have been unaware of Watterston's plans when initially appointing Meehan.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=103, 107–109}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=255}}

Watterston himself was indignant at his replacement, describing Meehan as "very ordinary" and unfitting for the Library of Congress.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=107–109}} He repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim the position for the rest of his life, through what biographer John McDonough described as a mix of "cajolery, threats, and flattery".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=6}} Despite his past as a partisan editor, Meehan remained a relatively apolitical librarian, and he retained his position through multiple [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presidencies.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=22}}

=== Tenure ===
[[File:Capitol of the U.S. at Washington 1825 (cropped).tif|thumb|1825 depiction of the [[U.S. Capitol]]. The Library of Congress would occupy a portion of the building until 1897.{{Sfn|Cole|1972|p=270}}|alt=A painting of the U.S. Capitol in 1825]]

When Meehan took office, the library was situated within the western portion of the [[U.S. Capitol]], and contained about 16,000 books.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}} He wrote in irritation at the conditions within the library, describing the various maintenance tasks needed to restore damaged books, clean shelves, and remove [[Bookworm (insect)|bookworms]]. In July 1832, Congress approved expansions to the [[Law Library of Congress]], designating a nearby room to hold the slightly over 2,000 [[law book]]s held in the collections. Around this time, Meehan appointed his son C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Wharton Meehan, previously employed as his assistant, to head the Law Library.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}}

From the outset, Meehan collaborated with the Congressional [[United States Congressional Joint Committee on the Library|Joint Committee on the Library]], often deferring to its advice regardless of partisan lines. He worked closely with the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] [[Edward Everett]] during the early 1830s. Maryland Senator [[James Pearce]] was appointed chairman of the Joint Committee in 1845, beginning a long-running period of close collaboration between him and Meehan. Historian Carl Ostrowski described Meehan as having "never made a move without first consulting Pearce".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=9–11}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=257}} Ostrowski characterized the Joint Committee during this period as negligent to the library, often not meeting or failing to achieve a quorum.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=113}}

The Joint Committee was generally on the forefront of management during the 1830s and 1840s. ''[[National Intelligencer]]'' coverage in the mid-1830s attributed the Library's holdings to various members of the committee, briefly praising Meehan for his "civility and attention" to visitors.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=109–110}} In contrast to Watterston's prominent role in discussion of American libraries, he is not mentioned within 1830s periodicals on American libraries.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|pp=109–110}}

==== Cataloguing and acquisitions ====
A steady appropriation of {{Usd|5,000}} a year for the purchase of books, plus an additional {{Usd|1,000}}–{{Usd|2,000}} for law books, was allocated to Meehan throughout his career with occasional exceptions. Meehan steadily acquired books, although he was criticized for prioritizing the acquisition of popular books over scholarly concerns.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=8}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=124}} Journalist [[Anne Royall]] rebuked him for his purchasing habits, claiming he had failed to "anticipate the research needs of legislators or scholars" and criticizing the acquisition of numerous books intended for [[Sunday school]] students.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}} Two major opportunities were presented to purchase expansive collections but were both denied by Congress, with Meehan doing little to advocate for the prospect. An 1836 offer to purchase Russian nobleman [[Dmitry Buturlin]]'s multilingual collection of 25,000 books was denied by a 17–16 vote. An offer in 1844 to acquire the [[Durazzo family]] library, containing over 10,000 volumes, was rejected for largely containing non-English literature.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=33–34}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=9}}

Classification systems in the library were archaic, with shelves placed in accordance with a modified version of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s original classification schema, itself based off the [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] conceptualization of knowledge. Books were generally categorized by subject and within subjects by size.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=121}} Library catalogs divided books by subject, with books within each subject listed alphabetically. Many years passed between different general catalogs of the library, requiring the consultation of additional supplementary listings.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=6–8}} A new catalog was produced in 1839, the first since 1830. The total number of volumes in the library had increased to around 30,000, encompassing 10,746 titles.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=121}} Over time, the time-intensive task of cataloging new entries was delegated to Meehan's assistant, E.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Stelle. The limited space and resources available to the library strongly limited the number of books which could be received. In 1849, Meehan wrote to the library's book agent [[Obadiah Rich]], noting that the "rooms for the accommodation of our Library are now so thoroughly filled, that we find it very difficult to take in any more books."{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=267}} Due to his reputation as a skilled businessman, Meehan was tasked by Congress to manage and book-keep what biographer John McDonough labeled a "bewildering variety of special funds" in addition to his duties within the library. Many of these were publishing or printing funds, with specific funds for the republication of the works of [[John Adams]], Thomas Jefferson, [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[James Madison]], as well as publications on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] and the Library of Congress catalog. Additional funds placed on Meehan's caseload included the funding for [[George Peter Alexander Healy|G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Healy]]'s portraits of presidents, a fund to acquire art for display at the Capitol, and the [[United States Botanic Garden]] Fund, which at times forced Meehan to supervise the garden's workers and handle correspondence with Congressmen seeking plant specimens for their home gardens.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=12}}[[File:Alexandre Vattemare Boston.png|alt=A black and white photograph of an aged Alexandre Vattemare near the end of his life|thumb|[[Alexandre Vattemare]]'s ineffective attempts at a transatlantic document exchange system frustrated Meehan.]]In 1840, French [[ventriloquist]] and actor [[Alexandre Vattemare]] received federal support for his proposed government document exchange system between the United States and France. Meehan provided Vattemare with 700 volumes of congressional documents, an amount "said to be twice as large as any in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]".{{Sfn|Gwinn|2010|p=109}} Widespread American enthusiasm for the program led to a massive quantity of documents, which Vattemare was unable to manage effectively. Meehan grew increasingly upset with the poor condition of shipments received through the program, describing the documents as poor quality and incomplete.{{Sfn|Gwinn|2010|pp=111–112}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=20–21}} At least two French diplomatic officials contacted Meehan and asked him not to pursue exchanges through Vattemare.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2004|p=113}} Congress terminated the program in June 1853. Despite this, Vattemare continued sporadic and unwanted shipments of books to the Library of Congress. The final shipment was sent in 1858, leading to a frustrated response from Meehan and the return of Vattemare's shipment, unopened.{{Sfn|Gwinn|2010|pp=111–112}}

==== Fire of 1851 and aftermath ====
Slightly before 8:00{{Nbsp}}am on December 24, 1851, [[1851 Library of Congress fire|a large fire]] broke out in the main room of the Library of Congress. Meehan was quickly summoned to the scene. Freezing temperatures impaired fire hoses, slowing efforts to put out the fire. While the main room was essentially unsalvageable, books in adjacent rooms were quickly moved to safety. A number of [[fire engine]] crews, alongside a group of nearby [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], were able to extinguish the blaze by around 11:00{{Nbsp}}am. About 35,000 of the library's 55,000 books were destroyed, alongside various paintings and statues. An inquiry was launched over the coming days to investigate the cause of the fire: after testimony from Meehan, [[Thomas Ustick Walter|Thomas U. Walter]], the [[Architect of the Capitol]], determined that the fire was sparked by the timbers of library alcoves extending into a [[chimney-flue]]. Any potential censures or charges were dismissed.{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=35–36}}{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=12–13}}

[[File:James Alfred Pearce, standing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Senator [[James Pearce]] served as Meehan's partner and ally for much of his tenure as librarian.|alt=A black and white photo of James Pearce]]

Pearce comforted Meehan in the aftermath of the 1851 fire, leading him to describe Pearce as "so eminent a gentleman, and so discriminating a friend".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=15}} Together with Walter, they worked steadily on rebuilding efforts over the course of 1852. Congress authorized various appropriations to finance the reconstruction of the library and the repurchase of lost books. By March 1852, temporary facilities for the library had been finished. The construction process of the main library faced numerous delays, irritating Meehan. While Walter had promised in March that the work would be completed in three months, the reconstruction of the main room was not finished until early 1853. Despite these delays, Meehan was extremely pleased with the library room, calling it "truly beautiful".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=15}}[[File:Library of Congress 1853 (cropped).jpg|alt=A drawing showing the interior of a multistory library|thumb|View of the library {{Circa|1853}}, following rebuilding]]Meehan commissioned [[Rich Brothers]], a London-based book dealing firm, to restock the library. His purchasing efforts were criticized by an anonymous two-part ''[[National Intelligencer]]'' article (sometimes attributed to [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] librarian [[Charles Coffin Jewett]]) stating that an agent should have been sent overseas to purchase books and that the Library of Congress should have attempted to become "a systematic collection of books chosen with competent bibliographic learning for a specific and well-defined purpose".{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=16}}{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|p=36}} Meehan rebuked the anonymous author, writing that such efforts would place "Congress in a position which admits that they cannot select the books they need."{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=16}}

Meehan diligently produced various "want lists" based on earlier catalogs.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=16–17}} Although control over what books the library was to purchase had been shifted from the Joint Committee to the librarian of Congress, Meehan reassured Pearce that the prior system was still in effect and that he did not intend to expand his control over book acquisition.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=16–17}}{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=260}} Congressman and educational reformer [[Horace Mann]] submitted a resolution to the committee shortly before his congressional retirement in March 1853, calling for the library to accept any of the lost books if offered at a cheaper price than other sellers. This was strongly opposed by Pearce and Meehan, who preferred the ease of purchases through the Rich Brothers. In response, they waited out Mann's retirement and the beginning of the [[33rd United States Congress]] and continued the previous path.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=260}}

The library's collections were restored by early 1856, following the purchase of 36,000 books at a "cost very far below the prices given for the lost books" through Rich Brothers.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=20}} Increased annual funding for the library, on top of various special appropriations, enabled the rapid growth of the library over the following years.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=18}} An attempt by Jewett and the Smithsonian Institution to re-catalog the library ended after criticism from Meehan. Rumors that President [[Franklin Pierce]] had appointed a new librarian of Congress troubled Meehan. After consultation with Pearce, he met with Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]], who reassured him that the rumors were unfounded. Secretary of State [[Lewis Cass]] of the succeeding Buchanan administration also reaffirmed Meehan's position as librarian.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=21–22}}

=== Removal ===
Following [[1860 United States presidential election|the election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the ensuing [[Ordinance of Secession|secession of the southern states]] in late 1860 and early 1861, Meehan's position became increasingly unstable. [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford|Ainsworth Spofford]] described him as a "very ancient fossil", and rumors began to circulate of pro-Southern sympathies.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=22–23}} Pearce wrote to Lincoln in March 1861, asking that Meehan be allowed to continue his role as librarian. Following extensive lobbying and support from various Midwestern Republicans, Indiana physician and Lincoln campaign delegate [[John Gould Stephenson]] was able to convince Lincoln to choose him for the position. Stephenson officially accepted his appointment on May 24, 1861, and Meehan left his duties at the end of the month.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=22–23}}{{Sfn|Carter|1976|pp=78–81}}

=== Legacy ===
Stephenson, Meehan's successor, complained that the library had fallen into disrepair and neglect. A December 1861 report commissioned by Stephenson (possibly written by Spofford) noted large numbers of uncleaned, miscataloged, and misplaced books. The cataloguing and purchasing systems were also noted to be deficient. Stephenson considered much of Meehan's library staff incompetent and initiated a mass change of staff; Meehan's son, Law Library head C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Wharton Meehan, became the sole retained assistant.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=24}}{{Sfn|Carter|1976|p=81}}

Later historians called into question Meehan's abilities as librarian, criticizing his inability to transform the Library of Congress into a [[national library]]. In his 1904 ''History of the Library of Congress'', historian William Dawson Johnston described Meehan as unable to foresee future needs of the library but able to maintain his position due to possessing "the second qualification of a successful administrator, that is, business ability".{{Sfn|Nappo|2016|pp=32–33}}{{Sfn|Johnston|1904|p=215}} Historian Carl Ostrowski was also critical of Meehan's contributions to the library, noting in 2000 that he chose to exercise little influence over any area of library policy.{{Sfn|Ostrowski|2000|p=257}}

== Personal life and death ==
Meehan and his wife Margaret had seven children. Margaret died during childbirth in July 1826, followed by her infant later the same day. Meehan remarried in October 1827 to Rachel T. Monington, his wife's sister, and the two would go on to have two more children together. Only three of Meehan's children outlived him.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=5}}

A year after leaving office, Meehan sought a position as a [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] clerk due to financial concerns. Pearce and [[William P. Fessenden]] wrote to Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] on Meehan's behalf to advocate for his employment.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|pp=24–28}} In the afternoon of April 24, 1863, Meehan suddenly died from [[apoplexy]] in his home in [[Capitol Hill]], Washington. An obituary described him as "[leaving] to his family that best inheritance, an unsullied name."{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=25}} C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Wharton Meehan continued in his role as custodian of the Law Library until his own death in July 1872.{{Sfn|McDonough|1976|p=8}}

{{Nuclear physics}}
'''Elise Meitner''' (7 November 1878 – 27 October 1968), commonly known as '''Lise Meitner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|z|ə|_|ˈ|m|aɪ|t|n|ər}} {{respell|LEE|zə|_|MYTE|nər}}; {{IPA|de|ˈliːzə ˈmaɪtnɐ|lang|De-Lise Meitner.ogg}}), was an Austrian-Swedish [[nuclear physicist]] who was instrumental in the [[discovery of nuclear fission]].

Completing her doctoral research in 1906, Meitner became the second woman from the [[University of Vienna]] to earn a doctorate in physics. She spent much of her scientific career in [[Berlin]], where she was a physics professor and a department head at the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]]. She was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany. She lost her positions in 1935 because of the anti-[[Jewish]] [[Nuremberg Laws]] of [[Nazi Germany]], and the 1938 [[Anschluss]] resulted in the loss of her Austrian citizenship. On 13–14 July 1938, she fled to the Netherlands with the help of [[Dirk Coster]]. She lived in [[Stockholm]] for many years, ultimately becoming a Swedish citizen in 1949, but relocated to Britain in the 1950s to be with family members.

In mid-1938, chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry demonstrated that [[isotope]]s of [[barium]] could be formed by [[neutron]] bombardment of [[uranium]]. Meitner was informed of their findings by Hahn, and in late December, with her nephew, fellow physicist [[Otto Robert Frisch]], she worked out the physics of this process by correctly interpreting Hahn and Strassmann's experimental data. On 13 January 1939, Frisch replicated the process Hahn and Strassmann had observed. In Meitner and Frisch's report in the February 1939 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', they gave the process the name "fission". The discovery of nuclear fission led to the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[atomic bomb]]s during [[World War II]].

Meitner did not share the 1944 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for nuclear fission, which was awarded to her long-time collaborator Otto Hahn. Several scientists and journalists have called her exclusion "unjust". According to the Nobel Prize archive, she was nominated 19 times for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry between 1924 and 1948, and 30 times for the Nobel Prize in Physics between 1937 and 1967. Despite not having been awarded the Nobel Prize, Meitner was invited to attend the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]] in 1962. She received many other honours, including the posthumous naming of element 109 [[meitnerium]] in 1997. Meitner was praised by [[Albert Einstein]] as the "German [[Marie Curie]]."<ref name="wapost" />

==Early years==
Elise Meitner was born on 7 November 1878 into a Jewish upper-middle-class family at the family home in 27 Kaiser Josefstraße in the [[Leopoldstadt]] district of [[Vienna]], the third of eight children of chess master [[Philipp Meitner]] and his wife Hedwig. The birth register of [[Vienna's Jewish community]] lists her as being born on 17 November 1878, but all other documents list her date of birth as 7 November, which is what she used.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=1}} Her father was one of the first Jewish lawyers admitted to practice in Austria.<ref name="wapost">{{cite news |first=Marcia |last=Bartusiak |author-link=Marcia Bartusiak |title=The Woman Behind the Bomb |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/lisemeitner.htm |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=17 March 1996 |access-date=28 December 2017 |archive-date=8 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308161333/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/lisemeitner.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> She had two older siblings, Gisela and Auguste (Gusti), and four younger: Moriz (Fritz), Carola (Lola), Frida and Walter; all ultimately pursued an advanced education.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=5–6}} Her father was a [[freethinker]], and she was brought up as such.<ref name="wapost" /> As an adult, she converted to Christianity, following [[Lutheranism]], and was baptised in 1908;<ref>{{cite odnb |last= Roqué |first= Xavier |title= Meitner, Lise (1878–1968), physicist |access-date= 27 October 2009 |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38821 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/38821 |year= 2004}}</ref>{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=6}} her sisters Gisela and Lola converted to [[Catholicism]] that same year.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=6}} She also adopted the shortened name "Lise".{{sfn|Offereins|2011|pp=69–74}}

==Education==
Meitner's interest in science began when she was eight, when she kept a notebook of her scientific research under her pillow. She was drawn to mathematics and science, and studied the colours of an oil slick, thin films, and reflected light. The only career available to women was teaching, so she attended a high school for girls where she trained as a French teacher. As well as French, her education included bookkeeping, arithmetic, history, geography, science and gymnastics. She completed high school in 1892. Women were not allowed to attend public institutions of higher education in Vienna until 1897, but when this restriction was lifted, the requirement for a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] education was waived and women only needed to pass the ''[[Maturazeugnis|matura]]'', the secondary school leaving qualification required for university entrance. Her sister Gisela passed the ''matura'' and entered medical school in 1900. Meitner began taking private lessons with two other young women in 1899, cramming the missing years of secondary education into two. Physics was taught by Arthur Szarvasy. In July 1901, they sat an external ''matura'' examination at the [[Akademisches Gymnasium]]. Four out of the fourteen women passed, including Meitner and Henriette Boltzmann, the daughter of physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].{{sfn|Watkins|1984|p=13}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=5–9}}

Meitner entered the [[University of Vienna]] in October 1901.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=10}} She was particularly inspired by Ludwig Boltzmann and often spoke with enthusiasm about his lectures.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=12–16}} Her dissertation was supervised by [[Franz Exner]] and his assistant [[Hans Benndorf]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=17}} Her thesis, titled {{lang|de|Prüfung einer Formel Maxwells}} ("Examination of a [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell Equation]]"), was submitted on 20 November 1905 and approved on 28 November. She passed an [[oral exam]] from Exner and Boltzmann on 19 December,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=398}} and was awarded her doctorate on 1 February 1906.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=16}} She became the second woman to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree]] in physics at the University of Vienna, after [[Olga Steindler]] who had received her degree in 1903;{{sfn|Sime|2005|p=7}} the third was [[Selma Freud]], who worked in the same laboratory as Meitner, and received hers in 1906.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=398}} Meitner's thesis was published as {{lang|de|Wärmeleitung in inhomogenen Körpern}} ("Thermal Conduction in Inhomogeneous Bodies") on 22 February 1906.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=398}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Meitner |first1=Lise |title=Wärmeleitung in inhomogenen Körpern |trans-title=Thermal Conduction in Inhomogeneous Bodies |url=https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/title/BV020318720 |publisher=Bayerische Staatsbibliothek |access-date=12 July 2020 |date=1906}}</ref>

[[Paul Ehrenfest]] asked her to investigate an article on [[optics]] by [[Lord Rayleigh]] detailing an experiment that produced results Rayleigh had been unable to explain. She was able to explain the results, and also made predictions based on her explanation, which she then verified experimentally, demonstrating her ability to carry out independent and unsupervised research.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=18–21}} She published the results in her report on "Some Conclusions Derived from the Fresnel Reflection Formula".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Lise |last=Meitner |title=Über einige Folgerungen, die sich aus den Fresnel'schen Reflexionsformeln ergeben |trans-title=Some Conclusions Derived from the Fresnel Reflection Formula |journal=Sitzungsberichte / Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Klasse.

===Friedrich Wilhelm University===
[[File:Hahn and Meitner in 1912.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in 1912]]
Encouraged and backed by her father's financial support, Meitner entered the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in [[Berlin]], where the renowned physicist [[Max Planck]] taught. Planck invited her to his home, and allowed her to attend his lectures. This was an unusual gesture by Planck, who was on record as opposing the admission of women to universities in general, but apparently recognised Meitner as an exception.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=24–26}} She became friends with Planck's twin daughters Emma and Grete, who were born in 1889, and shared Meitner's love of music.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=38}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Max Planck – a biographical overview |publisher=Max-Planck Gesellschaft |url=https://www.mpg.de/19252700/max-planck-biographical-overview |access-date=16 July 2024 |archive-date=16 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240716220806/https://www.mpg.de/19252700/max-planck-biographical-overview |url-status=live }}</ref>

Attending Planck's lectures did not take up all her time, and Meitner approached [[Heinrich Rubens]], the head of the experimental physics institute, about doing some research. Rubens said that he would be happy for her to work in his laboratory. He also added that [[Otto Hahn]] at the chemistry institute was looking for a physicist to collaborate with. A few minutes later she was introduced to Hahn. He had studied radioactive substances under [[William Ramsay]] and Ernest Rutherford, and was already credited with the discovery of what were then thought to be several new radioactive elements.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}}{{efn|In fact, they were [[isotope]]s of known elements, but the concept of an isotope, along with the term, was only propounded by [[Frederick Soddy]] in 1913.{{sfn|Hughes|2008|pp=134–135}} }} Hahn was the same age as Meitner, and she noted his informal and approachable manner.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}} In Montreal, Hahn had become accustomed to collaboration with physicists—including at least one woman, [[Harriet Brooks]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=28–29}}

[[File:Otto Hahn und Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|left|Meitner and Hahn in their laboratory, in 1913. When a colleague she did not recognise said that they had met before, Meitner replied: "You probably mistake me for Professor Hahn."{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=66}}]]
The head of the chemistry institute, [[Emil Fischer]], placed a former woodworking shop (''Holzwerkstatt'') at Hahn's disposal in the basement to use as a laboratory. Hahn equipped it with [[electroscope]]s to measure alpha and [[beta particle]]s and [[gamma rays]]. It was not possible to conduct research in the wood shop, but [[Alfred Stock]], the head of the inorganic chemistry department, let Hahn use a space in one of his two private laboratories.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=52}} Like Meitner, Hahn was unpaid, and lived off an allowance from his father, although somewhat larger than hers. He completed his [[habilitation]] in early 1907, and became a ''[[Privatdozent]]''.{{sfn|Stolz|1989|p=20}} Most of the organic chemists at the chemistry institute did not regard Hahn's work—detecting minute traces of [[isotope]]s too small to see, weigh or smell through their radioactivity—as real chemistry.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}} One department head remarked that "it is incredible what one gets to be a ''Privatdozent'' these days!"{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}}

The arrangement was difficult for Meitner at first. Women were not yet admitted to universities in the [[States of the German Empire|German state]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which included Berlin. Meitner was allowed to work in the wood shop, which had its own external entrance, but she could not enter the rest of the institute, including Hahn's laboratory space upstairs. If she wanted to go to the toilet, she had to use one at the restaurant down the street. The following year, women were admitted to Prussian universities, and Fischer lifted the restrictions, and had women's toilets installed in the building. Not all the chemists were happy about this.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=28–29}} The Institute of Physics was more accepting, and she became friends with the physicists there, including {{ill|Otto von Baeyer|de}}, [[James Franck]], [[Gustav Hertz]], [[Robert Pohl]], Max Planck, {{ill|Peter Pringsheim|de}} and [[Wilhelm Westphal]].{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=65}}

During the first years Meitner worked with Hahn, they co-authored nine papers: three in 1908 and six in 1909. Together with Hahn, she discovered and developed a physical separation method known as [[atomic recoil|radioactive recoil]], in which a [[daughter nucleus]] is forcefully ejected as it recoils at the moment of decay. While Hahn was more concerned with discovering new elements (now known to be isotopes), Meitner was more interested in understanding their radiation. She observed that radioactive recoil, which had been discovered by Harriet Brooks in 1904, could be a new way of detecting radioactive substances. They soon discovered two more new isotopes, bismuth-211 and thallium-207.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=58–64}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Dava |last=Dava Sobel |author-link=Dava Sobel |date=2 July 2020 |title=Harriet Brooks |publisher=Linda Hall Library |url=https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/harriet-brooks/ |access-date=21 July 2024 |archive-date=21 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240721212403/https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/harriet-brooks/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=H.

By this time, they were known to be [[electron]]s. Alpha particles were emitted with characteristic energy, and she expected that this would be true of beta particles too. Hahn and Meitner carefully measured the absorption of beta particles by aluminium, but the results were puzzling. In 1914, [[James Chadwick]] found that electrons emitted from the nucleus formed a continuous spectrum, but Meitner found this hard to believe, as it seemed to contradict [[quantum physics]], which held that electrons in an atom can only occupy discrete energy states (quanta).{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=551–553}}

In 1912, Hahn and Meitner moved to the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (KWI) for Chemistry]] in Berlin. Hahn accepted an offer from Fischer to become a junior assistant in charge of its [[radiochemistry]] section, the first laboratory of its kind in Germany. The job came with the title of "professor" and a salary of 5,000 marks per annum ({{Inflation|DE|5,000|1912|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}). Unlike the universities, the privately funded KWI had no policies excluding women, but Meitner worked without pay as a "guest" in Hahn's section.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Sime|2005|p=11}} She may have encountered financial difficulties after the death of her father in 1910. Fearing she might return to Vienna, Planck appointed her as his assistant at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in the Friedrich Wilhelm University. As such, she marked his students' papers. It was her first paid position. Assistant was the lowest rung on the academic ladder, and Meitner was the first female scientific assistant in Prussia.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=66}}

Proud officials presented Meitner to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] at the official opening of the KWI for Chemistry on 23 October 1912.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=70–71}} The following year she became a ''Mitglied'' (associate) like Hahn (although her salary was still less),{{sfn|Sime|2005|p=11}} and the radioactivity section became the Hahn-Meitner Laboratory. Meitner celebrated with a dinner party at the [[Hotel Adlon]]. Hahn and Meitner's salaries would soon be dwarfed by royalties from [[mesothorium]] ("middle thorium", radium-228, also called "German radium") produced for medical purposes, for which Hahn received 66,000 marks in 1914 ({{Inflation|DE|66,000|1914|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}). He gave ten per cent to Meitner.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=47}} In 1914, Meitner was offered an academic position in [[Prague]], which was then part of her country of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Planck made it clear to Fischer that he did not want Meitner to leave, and Fischer arranged for her salary to be doubled to 3,000 marks ({{Inflation|DE|3,000|1914|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}).{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=48}}

The move to new accommodation was fortunate, as the wood shop had become thoroughly contaminated by radioactive liquids that had been spilt, and radioactive gases that had vented and decayed then settled as radioactive dust, making sensitive measurements impossible. To ensure that their clean new laboratories stayed that way, Hahn and Meitner instituted strict procedures. Chemical and physical measurements were conducted in different rooms, people handling radioactive substances had to follow protocols that included not shaking hands, and rolls of toilet paper were hung next to every telephone and door handle. Strongly radioactive substances were stored in the old wood shop, and later in a purpose-built [[radium]] house on the institute grounds.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=48}}

==World War I and the discovery of protactinium==
In July 1914—shortly before the outbreak of [[World War I]]—Hahn was called to active duty with the army in a ''[[Landwehr]]'' regiment.{{sfn|Van der Kloot|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Spence|1970|pp=286–287}} Meitner undertook X-ray technician training, and a course on anatomy at the city hospital in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]].{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=66}} Meanwhile, she completed both the work on the [[beta ray]] spectrum that she had begun before the war with Hahn and Baeyer, and her own study of the uranium [[decay chain]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=55}} In July 1915, she returned to Vienna, where she joined the Austrian Army as an X-ray nurse-technician. Her unit was deployed to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]] in Poland, and she also served on the [[Italian front (World War I)|Italian front]] before being discharged in September 1916.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=59–62}}

Meitner returned to the KWI for Chemistry and her research in October. In January 1917, she was appointed as head of her own physics section. The Hahn-Meitner Laboratory was divided into separate Hahn and Meitner Laboratories, and her pay was increased to 4,000 marks ({{Inflation|DE|4,000|1917|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}).<ref name="wapost" />{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=65}} Hahn returned to Berlin on leave, and they discussed another loose end from their pre-war work: the search for the mother isotope of [[actinium]] (element 89). According to the [[radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy]], this had to be an isotope of the undiscovered element 91 on the [[periodic table]] that lay between [[thorium]] (element 90) and uranium (element 92). [[Kasimir Fajans]] and [[Oswald Helmuth Göhring]] discovered the missing element in 1913, and named it ''brevium'' after its short half-life. However, the isotope they had found was a beta emitter, and therefore could not be the mother isotope of actinium. This had to be another isotope of the same element.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}

In 1914, Hahn and Meitner had developed a new technique for separating the [[tantalum]] group from [[pitchblende]], which they hoped would speed the isolation of the new isotope. When Meitner resumed this work in 1917, Hahn and most of the students, laboratory assistants and technicians had been called up to serve in the armed forces, so Meitner had to do everything herself. In February, she extracted 2 grams of [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|Si|O|2}}) from 21 grams of pitchblende. She set 1.5 grams aside and added a [[tantalum pentafluoride]] ({{chem|Ta|F|5}}) carrier to the other 0.5 grams, which she dissolved in [[hydrogen fluoride]] ({{chem|H|F}}). She then boiled it in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|S|O|4}}), precipitated what was believed to be element 91, and verified that it was an alpha emitter. Hahn came home on leave in April, and together they devised a series of tests to eliminate other sources of alpha particles. The only known ones with similar chemical behaviour were [[lead-210]] (which decays to alpha emitter [[polonium-210]] via [[bismuth-210]]) and [[thorium-230]].{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}

Further investigation required more [[pitchblende]]. Meitner went to Vienna, where she met with Stefan Meyer. The export of uranium from Austria was forbidden due to wartime restrictions, but Meyer was able to offer her a kilogram of uranium residue, pitchblende from which the uranium had been removed, which was actually better for her purpose. The tests showed that the alpha activity was not due to these substances. All that now remained was to find evidence of actinium. For this yet more pitchblende was required, but this time Meyer was unable to assist, as the export was now prohibited. Meitner managed to obtain 100&nbsp;g of "double residue"—pitchblende without uranium or radium—from [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]] and began tests with 43 grams of it, but its composition was different, and at first her tests did not work. With Giesel's help, she was able to produce a pure product that was strongly radioactive. By December 1917 she was able to isolate both the mother isotope and its actinium daughter product. She submitted their findings for publication in March 1918.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}<ref>{{citation |first=Lise |last=Meitner |author-link=Lise Meitner |title=Die Muttersubstanz des Actiniums, Ein Neues Radioaktives Element von Langer Lebensdauer |trans-title=The Parent Substance of Actinium, a New Radioactive Element with a Long Lifetime |volume=19 |issue=11–12 |pages=169–173 |date=1 June 1918 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bbpc.19180241107 |access-date=3 June 2021 |journal=Zeitschrift für Elektrochemie und angewandte physikalische Chemie |doi=10.1002/bbpc.19180241107 |s2cid=94448132 |archive-date=16 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016222127/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bbpc.19180241107 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although Fajans and Göhring had been the first to discover the element, custom required that an element was represented by its longest-lived and most abundant isotope, and brevium did not seem appropriate. Fajans agreed to Meitner naming the element "protoactinium" (subsequently shortened to [[protactinium]]), and assigning it the chemical symbol Pa. In June 1918, Soddy and [[John Arnold Cranston|John Cranston]] announced that they had independently extracted a sample of the isotope, but unlike Meitner they were unable to describe its characteristics. They acknowledged Meitner's priority, and agreed to the name. The connection to uranium remained a mystery, as neither of the two known [[isotopes of uranium]] ([[uranium-234]] and [[uranium-238]]) decayed into protactinium. It remained unsolved until [[uranium-235]] was discovered by [[Arthur Jeffrey Dempster]] in 1935.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dempster |first=A. |author-link=Arthur Jeffrey Dempster |title=Isotopic Constitution of Uranium |journal=Nature |issn=0028-0836 |volume=136 |issue=180 |date=3 August 1935 |page=180 |doi=10.1038/136180a0 |bibcode=1935Natur.136..180D }}</ref>

==Beta radiation==
In 1921, Meitner accepted an invitation from [[Manne Siegbahn]] to come to Sweden and give a series of lectures on radioactivity as a visiting professor at [[Lund University]]. She found that very little research had been done on radioactivity in Sweden, but she was eager to learn about [[X-ray spectroscopy]], which was Siegbahn's specialty. At his laboratory, she met a Dutch doctoral candidate, [[Dirk Coster]], who was studying X-ray spectroscopy, and his wife Miep, who was working on her doctorate in Indonesian language and culture. Armed with her newly acquired knowledge of X-ray spectroscopy, Meitner took a fresh look at the beta-ray spectra when she returned to Berlin.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=653–657}} It was known that some beta emission was primary, with electrons being ejected directly from the nucleus, and some was secondary, in which alpha particles from the nucleus knocked electrons out of orbit. Meitner was sceptical of Chadwick's claim that the [[spectral line]]s were entirely due to secondary electrons, while the primary ones formed a continuous spectrum.{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=552–553}} Using techniques developed by [[Jean Danysz]], she examined the spectra of lead-210, [[radium-226]] and [[thorium-238]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=86}} Meitner discovered the cause of the emission of electrons from surfaces of atoms with "signature" energies, now known as the [[Auger-Meitner effect]], in 1922.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=90}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last1 =Meitner |first1=L. |doi=10.1007/BF01326962 |title=Über die Entstehung der β-Strahl-Spektren radioaktiver Substanzen |language=de |trans-title=On the origin of the β-ray spectra of radioactive substances |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |issn=0044-3328 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=131–144 |year=1922 |bibcode=1922ZPhy....9..131M |s2cid=121637546 }}</ref> The effect is co-named after [[Pierre Victor Auger]], who independently discovered it in 1923.<ref>{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Auger |author-link=Pierre Victor Auger |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3130n.image.f187.langFR |title=Sur les rayons β secondaires produits dans un gaz par des rayons X |language=fr |trans-title=On the secondary β-rays produced in a gas by X-rays |journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences |volume=177 |date=1923 |pages=169–171 |access-date=30 May 2011 |archive-date=15 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015233109/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3130n.image.f187.langFR |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Meitner published before Auger, but the effect does not bear her name.

Women were granted the right of habilitation in Prussia in 1920, and in 1922 Meitner was granted her habilitation and became a ''[[Privatdozentin]]''. She was the first woman to receive her habilitation in physics in Prussia, and only the second in Germany after [[Hedwig Kohn]]. Since Meitner had already published over 40 papers, she was not required to submit a thesis, but [[Max von Laue]] recommended that the requirement for an inaugural lecture not be waived, since he was interested in what she had to say. She therefore gave an inaugural lecture on "Problems of Cosmic Physics".{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=109–110, 421}} From 1923 to 1933, she taught a [[seminar|colloquium]] or [[tutorial]] at Friedrich Wilhelm University each semester, and supervised doctoral students at the KWI for Chemistry.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=109–110, 421}} In 1926, she became an ''[[außerordentlicher Professor]]'' (extraordinary professor), the first woman university physics professor in Germany. Her physics section became larger, and she acquired a permanent assistant. Scientists from Germany and around the world came to the KWI for Chemistry to conduct research under her supervision.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=109–110, 421}} In 1930, Meitner taught a seminar on "Questions of Atomic Physics and Atomic Chemistry" with [[Leó Szilárd]].{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=100–101}}

Meitner had a [[Wilson cloud chamber]] constructed at the KWI for Chemistry, the first one in Berlin, and with her student Kurt Freitag studied the tracks of alpha particles that did not collide with a nucleus.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=113}} With her assistant Kurt Philipp she later used it to take the first images of [[positron]] traces from gamma radiation. She proved Chadwick's assertion that the discrete spectral lines were entirely the result of secondary electrons, and the continuous spectra were therefore indeed entirely caused by the primary ones. In 1927, [[Charles Drummond Ellis]] and William Alfred Wooster measured the energy of the continuous spectrum produced by the beta decay of [[bismuth-210]] at 0.34&nbsp;[[MeV]] where the energy of each disintegration was 0.35&nbsp;MeV. Thus, the spectrum accounted for nearly, but not all, of the energy. Meitner found this result so troubling that she repeated the experiment with [[Wilhelm Orthmann]] using an improved method, and verified Ellis and Wooster's results.{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=552–553}}<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/119563c0 |title=The Continuous Spectrum of β-Rays |journal=Nature |issn=0028-0836 |volume=119 |issue=2998 |pages=563–564 |year=1927 |last1=Ellis |first1=C.

It appeared that the [[law of conservation of energy]] did not hold for beta decay, something Meitner regarded as unacceptable. In 1930, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] wrote an open letter to Meitner and [[Hans Geiger]] in which he proposed that the continuous spectrum was caused by the emission of a second particle during beta decay, one that had no electric charge and little or no [[rest mass]]. The idea was taken up by [[Enrico Fermi]] in his 1934 [[Fermi's interaction|theory of beta decay]], and he gave the name "[[neutrino]]" to the hypothetical neutral particle. At the time there was scant hope of detecting neutrinos, but in 1956 [[Clyde Cowan]] and [[Frederick Reines]] did just that.{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=552–553}}

==Nazi Germany==
[[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as the [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933, as his [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) was now the largest party in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]''.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=135}} The 7 April 1933 [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] removed Jews from the civil service, which included academia. Meitner never tried to conceal her Jewish descent, but initially was exempt from its impact on multiple grounds: she had been employed before 1914, had served in the military during the World War, was an Austrian rather than a German citizen, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was a government-industry partnership.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=138–139}} However, she was dismissed from her adjunct professorship on 6 September on the grounds that her World War I service was not at the front, and she had not completed her habilitation until 1922. This had no effect on her salary or work at the KWI for Chemistry.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=150}} [[Carl Bosch]], the director of [[IG Farben]], a major sponsor of the KWI for Chemistry, assured Meitner that her position there was safe.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=138–139}} Although Hahn and Meitner remained in charge, their assistants, Otto Erbacher and Kurt Philipp respectively, who were both NSDAP members, were given increasing influence over the day-to-day running of the institute.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=153}}

Others were not so fortunate; her nephew [[Otto Robert Frisch]] was dismissed from his post in the Institute for Physical Chemistry at the [[University of Hamburg]], as was [[Otto Stern]], the director of the institute. Stern found Frisch a position with [[Patrick Blackett]] at [[Birkbeck College]] in England,{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=51–52}} and he later worked at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in Copenhagen from 1934 to 1939.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|p=81}} [[Fritz Strassman]] had come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry to study under Hahn to improve his employment prospects. He declined a lucrative offer of employment because it required political training and Nazi Party membership, and resigned from the [[Society of German Chemists]] when it became part of the Nazi [[German Labour Front]] rather than become a member of a Nazi-controlled organisation. As a result, he could neither work in the chemical industry nor receive his habilitation. Meitner persuaded Hahn to hire him as an assistant. Soon he would be credited as a third collaborator on the papers they produced, and would sometimes even be listed first.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=156–157, 169}}{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=122}} Between 1933 and 1935, Meitner published exclusively in the journal ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'', as its editor [[Arnold Berliner]] was Jewish, and he continued to accept submissions from Jewish scientists. This generated a boycott of the publication, and in August 1935 the publisher, [[Springer-Verlag]], fired Berliner.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=151–152}}

==Transmutation==
After Chadwick discovered the [[neutron]] in 1932,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=39, 160–167, 793}} [[Irène Curie]] and [[Frédéric Joliot]] irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles, and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive [[isotopes of phosphorus|isotope of phosphorus]]. They noted that [[positron emission]] continued after the irradiation ceased. Not only had they discovered a new form of radioactive decay, they had transmuted an element into a hitherto unknown radioactive isotope of another, thereby inducing radioactivity where there had been none before. Radiochemistry was now no longer confined to certain heavy elements, but extended to the entire periodic table.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=161–162}} Chadwick noted that being electrically neutral, neutrons could penetrate the nucleus more easily than protons or alpha particles.{{sfn|Fergusson|2011|p=1151}} Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome picked up on this idea,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=210–211}} and began irradiating elements with neutrons.{{sfn|Segrè|1989|pp=39–40}}

The radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy said that beta decay causes isotopes to move one element up on the periodic table, and alpha decay causes them to move two down. When Fermi's group bombarded uranium atoms with neutrons, they found a complex mix of half lives. Fermi therefore concluded that new elements with atomic numbers greater than 92 (known as [[transuranium elements]]) had been created.{{sfn|Segrè|1989|pp=39–40}} Meitner and Hahn had not collaborated for many years, but Meitner was eager to investigate Fermi's results. Hahn, initially, was not, but he changed his mind when [[Aristid von Grosse]] suggested that what Fermi had found was an isotope of protactinium.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=164–165}} "The only question", Hahn later wrote, "seemed to be whether Fermi had found isotopes of transuranium elements, or isotopes of the next-lower element, protactinium. At that time Lise Meitner and I decided to repeat Fermi's experiments in order to find out whether the 13-minute isotope was a protactinium isotope or not. It was a logical decision, having been the discoverers of protactinium."{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=140–141}}

Between 1934 and 1938, Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann found a great number of radioactive transmutation products, all of which they regarded as transuranic.{{sfn|Hahn|1958|p=78}} At that time, the existence of [[actinide]]s was not yet established, and uranium was wrongly believed to be a [[group 6 element]] similar to [[tungsten]]. It followed that the first transuranic elements would be similar to group 7 to 10 elements, [[rhenium]] and [[platinoid]]s. They established the presence of multiple isotopes of at least four such elements, and (mistakenly) identified them as elements with atomic numbers 93 to 96. They were the first scientists to measure the 23-minute half life of the [[synthetic radioisotope]] uranium-239 and to establish chemically that it was an isotope of uranium, but with their weak neutron sources they were unable to continue this work to its logical conclusion and identify the real element 93. They identified ten different half lives, with varying degrees of certainty. To account for them, Meitner had to hypothesise a new class of reaction and the alpha decay of uranium, neither of which had ever been reported before, and for which physical evidence was lacking. Hahn and Strassmann refined their chemical procedures, while Meitner devised new experiments to examine the reaction processes.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=170–172}}

In May 1937, Hahn and Meitner issued parallel reports, one in ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' with Meitner as the first author, and one in ''Chemische Berichte'' with Hahn as the first author.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=170–172}}<ref name="Meitner 1937">{{cite journal |first1=L. |last1=Meitner |author-link1=Lise Meitner |first2=O. |last2=Hahn |first3=F. |last3=Strassmann |author-link3=Fritz Strassmann |title=Über die Umwandlungsreihen des Urans, die durch Neutronenbestrahlung erzeugt werden |trans-title=On the series of transformations of uranium that are generated by neutron radiation |language=de |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |issn=0939-7922 |volume=106 |issue=3–4 |pages=249–270 |date=May 1937 |doi=10.1007/BF01340321 |bibcode=1937ZPhy..106..249M |s2cid=122830315 }}</ref><ref name="Hahn 1937">{{cite journal |first1=O. |last1=Hahn |first2=L. |last2=Meitner |author-link2=Lise Meitner |first3=F. |last3=Strassmann |author-link3=Fritz Strassmann |title=Über die Trans-Urane und ihr chemisches Verhalten |trans-title=On the transuranes and their chemical behaviour |journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |issn=0365-9496 |date=9 June 1937 |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1374–1392 |doi=10.1002/cber.19370700634 }}</ref> Hahn concluded his by stating emphatically: {{lang|de|Vor allem steht ihre chemische Verschiedenheit von allen bisher bekannten Elementen außerhalb jeder Diskussion}} ("Above all, their chemical distinction from all previously known elements needs no further discussion").<ref name="Hahn 1937"/> Meitner was increasingly uncertain. She considered the possibility that the reactions were from different isotopes of uranium; three were known: uranium-238, uranium-235 and uranium-234. However, when she calculated the [[neutron cross section]], it was too large to be anything other than the most abundant isotope, uranium-238, and concluded that it must be another case of [[nuclear isomerism]], a phenomenon Hahn had discovered in protactinium years before. She therefore ended her report on a very different note to Hahn, reporting that: "The process must be neutron capture by uranium-238, which leads to three isomeric nuclei of uranium-239. This result is very difficult to reconcile with current concepts of the nucleus."<ref name="Meitner 1937" />{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=177}}

==Escape from Germany==
With the ''[[Anschluss]]'', Germany's annexation of Austria on 12 March 1938, Meitner lost her Austrian citizenship.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=184–185}} [[Niels Bohr]] extended an offer to lecture in Copenhagen, and [[Paul Scherrer]] invited her to attend a congress in Switzerland, with all expenses paid. Carl Bosch still said that she could remain at the KWI for Chemistry, but by May she was aware that the [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture]] was looking into her case. On 9 May, she decided to accept Bohr's invitation to go to Copenhagen, where Frisch worked,{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=262}} but when she went to the Danish consulate to get a [[travel visa]], she was told that Denmark no longer recognised her Austrian passport as valid. She could not leave for Denmark, Switzerland or any other country.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=189–190}}

Bohr came to Berlin in June, and was gravely concerned. When he returned to Copenhagen, he began looking for a position for Meitner in Scandinavia. He also asked [[Hans Kramers]] to see if anything was available in the Netherlands. Kramers contacted Coster, who in turn notified [[Adriaan Fokker]]. Coster and Fokker attempted to secure a position for Meitner at the [[University of Groningen]]. They found that the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] would not support refugee scientists, and that the [[International Federation of University Women]] had been flooded with applications for support from Austria. On 27 June, Meitner received an offer of a one-year position at Manne Siegbahn's new  {{ill|Manne Siegbahn Laboratory|sv|Manne Siegbahnlaboratoriet}} in [[Stockholm]], then under construction, which would be devoted to nuclear physics, and she decided to accept it. But on 4 July she learned that academics would no longer be granted permission to travel abroad.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=263}}

[[File:Flugsnapparen 8.JPG|thumb|left|Meitner lived at this address for most of her years while in Sweden.]]
Through Bohr in Copenhagen, [[Peter Debye]] communicated with Coster and Fokker, and they approached the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Netherlands Ministry of Education]] with an appeal to allow Meitner to come to the Netherlands. As foreigners were not allowed to work for pay, an appointment as a non-salaried ''privaat-docente'' was required. [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] arranged for one at [[Leiden University]].{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=264}} Coster also spoke to the head of the border guards, who assured him that Meitner would be admitted. A friend of Coster, E. H. Ebels, was a local politician from the border area, and he spoke directly to the guards on the border.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=265}}

On 11 July, Coster arrived in Berlin, where he stayed with Debye.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=265}} The following morning, Meitner arrived early at the KWI for Chemistry, and Hahn briefed her on the plan. To avoid suspicion, she maintained her usual routine, remaining at the institute until 20:00 correcting one of the associate's papers for publication. Hahn and [[Paul Rosbaud]] helped her pack two small suitcases, carrying only summer clothes. Hahn gave her a diamond ring he had inherited from his mother in case of emergency; she took only 10 marks in her purse ({{Inflation|DE|10|1938|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-1}}). She then spent the night at Hahn's house. The next morning Meitner met Coster at the railway station, where they pretended to have met by chance. They travelled on a lightly used line to [[Bad Nieuweschans railway station]] on the border, which they crossed without incident;{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=266}} the German border guards may have thought that Meitner was the wife of a professor.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=267}} A telegram from Pauli informed Coster that he was now "as famous for the abduction of Lise Meitner as for the discovery of hafnium".{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=205}}

Meitner learned on 26 July that Sweden had granted her permission to enter on her Austrian passport, and two days later she flew to Copenhagen, where she was greeted by Frisch, and stayed with Niels and [[Margrethe Bohr]] at their holiday house in [[Tisvilde]]. On 1 August she travelled by train and steamship to [[Göteborg]] station in Sweden, where she was met at by [[Eva von Bahr (physicist)|Eva von Bahr]]. They took a train, and then a steamer, to von Bahr's home in [[Kungälv]], where she stayed until September.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=207}} Hahn told everyone at the KWI for Chemistry that Meitner had gone to Vienna to visit her relatives, and a few days later the institute had closed for the summer. On 23 August, she wrote to Bosch requesting retirement.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=210}} He tried to ship her belongings to Sweden, but the Reich Ministry of Education insisted they remain in Germany.{{sfn|Sime|1990|pp=215–216}}

Meitner was also concerned about her family in Austria. One of her first actions in Sweden was to apply for a Swedish immigration permit for Gusti and her husband Justinian (Jutz) Frisch.{{sfn|Sime|1990|pp=215–216}} Hahn selected [[Josef Mattauch]] to replace her as head of the physics section, and went to Vienna to offer him the job. While there he dined with Meitner's sisters Gusti and Gisela and their husbands Jutz Frisch and Karl Lion on 9 November. The next day Gusti informed him that Frisch had been arrested. That day, Meitner arrived in Copenhagen; arranging a travel visa had been difficult with her invalid Austrian passport. Hahn joined her in Copenhagen on 13 November, and had discussions about the uranium research with Meitner, Bohr and Otto Robert Frisch.{{sfn|Sime|1990|pp=226–228}}

==Nuclear fission==
{{main|Discovery of nuclear fission}}
[[File:Nuclear Fission Experimental Apparatus 1938 - Deutsches Museum - Munich.jpg|thumb|right|This was touted for many years as the table and experimental apparatus with which Otto Hahn discovered nuclear fission in 1938. The table and instruments are representative of the ones used, but not necessarily the originals, and would not have been together on the one table in the same room. Pressure from historians, scientists and feminists caused the [[Deutsches Museum]] to alter the display in 1988 to acknowledge the role of Meitner, Frisch and Strassmann.{{sfn|Sime|2010|pp=206–211}} ]]
Hahn and Strassmann isolated the three radium isotopes (verified by their half-lives) and used fractional crystallisation to separate it from its barium carrier by adding [[barium bromide]] crystals in four steps. Since radium precipitates preferentially in a solution of barium bromide, at each step the fraction drawn off would contain less radium than the one before. However, they found no difference between each of the fractions. In case their process was faulty in some way, they verified it with known isotopes of radium; the process was fine. On 19 December, Hahn wrote to Meitner, informing her that the radium isotopes behaved chemically like barium. Anxious to finish up before the Christmas break, Hahn and Strassmann submitted their findings to ''Naturwissenschaften'' on 22 December without waiting for Meitner to reply.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=233–234}} Hahn concluded the paper with: "As chemists... we should substitute the symbols Ba, La, Ce for Ra, Ac, Th. As 'nuclear chemists' fairly close to physics we cannot yet bring ourselves to take this step which contradicts all previous experience in physics."<ref>{{cite journal |first1=O. |last1=Hahn |author-link1=Otto Hahn |first2=F. |last2=Strassmann |s2cid=5920336 |author-link2=Fritz Strassmann |title=Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle |language=de |trans-title=Concerning the existence of alkaline earth metals resulting from neutron irradiation of uranium |journal=Naturwissenschaften |issn=0028-1042 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=11–15 |date=6 January 1939 |doi=10.1007/BF01488241 |bibcode=1939NW.....27...11H }}</ref>

Frisch normally celebrated Christmas with Meitner in Berlin, but in 1938 she accepted an invitation from Eva von Bahr to spend it with her family at [[Kungälv]], and Meitner asked Frisch to join her there. Meitner received the letter from Hahn describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium. Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium, and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=113–114}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=235–239}} Nonetheless, she had immediately written back to Hahn to say: "At the moment the assumption of such a thoroughgoing breakup seems very difficult to me, but in nuclear physics we have experienced so many surprises, that one cannot unconditionally say: 'It is impossible.'"{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=235}}

[[File:Liquid drop model of nuclear fission.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Liquid-drop model]] of nuclear fission]]
Meitner dismissed the possibility that Hahn's identification of barium was in error; her faith in Hahn's expertise as a chemist was absolute. Meitner and Frisch then considered how it could be possible. Previous attempts at atom splitting had never had enough energy to chip away more than individual protons or alpha particles, but a barium nucleus was much larger. They considered the [[liquid-drop model]] of the nucleus that had been proposed by [[George Gamow]]: perhaps it was possible for a drop to become elongated and then divide itself in two.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=115–116}}

Frisch later wrote:{{blockquote|text=<p>At that point we both sat down on a tree trunk (all that discussion had taken place while we walked through the wood in the snow, I with my skis on, Lise Meitner making good her claim that she could walk just as fast without), and started to calculate on scraps of paper. The charge of a uranium nucleus, we found, was indeed large enough to overcome the effect of the surface tension almost completely; so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop, ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation, such as the impact of a single neutron.</p><p>But there was another problem. After separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200&nbsp;MeV in all; where could that energy come from? Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered the empirical formula for computing the masses of nuclei and worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s formula ''E''&nbsp;= ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, and one-fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200&nbsp;MeV. So here was the source for that energy; it all fitted!{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=115–116}}</p> }}

The table (on loan from the Deutsches Museum Munich) is now described as a replica and images of Meitner and Strassmann are prominently displayed.]]
Meitner and Frisch had correctly interpreted Hahn's results to mean that the nucleus of uranium had split roughly in half. The first two reactions that the Berlin group had observed were light elements created by the breakup of uranium nuclei; the third, the 23-minute one, was a decay into the real element 93.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=243}} On returning to Copenhagen, Frisch informed Bohr, who slapped his forehead and exclaimed "What idiots we have been!"{{sfn|Frisch|1979|p=116}} Bohr promised not to say anything until they had a paper ready for publication. To speed the process, they decided to submit a one-page note to ''Nature''. At this point, the only evidence that they had was the barium. Logically, if barium was formed, the other element must be [[krypton]],{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=246}} but Hahn had mistakenly believed that the [[atomic mass]]es had to add up to 239 rather than the [[atomic number]]s adding up to 92, and thought it was masurium ([[technetium]]), and so did not check for it:{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=239, 456}}
: {{chem||92|U}} + n → {{chem||56|Ba}} + {{chem||36|Kr}} + some n {{efn|Although Hahn and Strassmann believed that fission had occurred in the uranium-238 isotope, their observations indicate that they actually observed fission in uranium-235.{{sfn|Steinhauser|2016|pp=265–266}} }}   

Over a series of long-distance phone calls, Meitner and Frisch came up with a simple experiment to bolster their claim: to measure the recoil of the fission fragments, using a [[Geiger counter]] with the threshold set above that of the alpha particles. Frisch conducted the experiment on 13 January, and found the pulses caused by the reaction just as they had predicted.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=246}} He decided he needed a name for the newly discovered nuclear process. He spoke to William A. Arnold, an American biologist working with [[George de Hevesy]], and asked him what biologists called the process by which living cells divided into two. Arnold told him that biologists called it [[fission (biology)|fission]]. Frisch then applied that name to the nuclear process in his paper.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=263}} He mailed both papers to ''Nature'' on 16 January; the jointly-authored note appeared in print on 11 February and Frisch's paper on recoil on 18 February.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=L. |last1=Meitner |author-link1=Lise Meitner |first2=O.

These three reports, the first Hahn-Strassmann publications of 6 January and 10 February 1939, and the Frisch-Meitner publication of 11 February 1939, had electrifying effects on the scientific community.{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|pages=54–56}} In 1940 Frisch and [[Rudolf Peierls]] produced the [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]], which established that an atomic explosion could be generated.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|pp=441–446}}

==Nobel Prize==
Despite the many honours that Meitner received in her lifetime, she did not receive the Nobel Prize while it was awarded to Otto Hahn for the discovery of nuclear fission. She was nominated 49 times for Physics and Chemistry Nobel Prizes but never won.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel prize – Nomination archive – Lise Meitner|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=6097/|access-date=30 August 2022  |publisher=Nobel Foundation |date=April 2020 |archive-date=6 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230306004948/https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=6097/|url-status=live}}</ref> On 15 November 1945, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] announced that Hahn had been awarded the 1944 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for "his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1944 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/index.html |access-date=26 August 2011 |archive-date=25 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225083657/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{efn|The Nobel Committee had decided to defer the 1944 award for one year due to the war.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}} }} Meitner was the one who told Hahn and Strassman to test their radium in more detail, and it was she who told Hahn that it was possible for the nucleus of uranium to disintegrate. Without these contributions of Meitner, Hahn would not have found that the uranium nucleus can split in half.{{sfn|Sime|1989|pp=373–376}}

In 1945 the [[Nobel Committee for Chemistry]] in Sweden that selected the Nobel Prize in Chemistry decided to award that prize solely to Hahn, who found out from a newspaper while detained in [[Farm Hall]] in England. In the 1990s, the long-sealed records of the Nobel Committee's proceedings became public, and the comprehensive biography of Meitner published in 1996 by [[Ruth Lewin Sime]] took advantage of this unsealing to reconsider Meitner's exclusion.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}} In a 1997 article in the [[American Physical Society]] journal ''[[Physics Today]]'', Sime and her colleagues Elisabeth Crawford and Mark Walker wrote: {{blockquote|It appears that Lise Meitner did not share the 1944 prize because the structure of the Nobel committees was ill-suited to assess interdisciplinary work; because the members of the chemistry committee were unable or unwilling to judge her contribution fairly; and because during the war the Swedish scientists relied on their own limited expertise. Meitner's exclusion from the chemistry award may well be summarized as a mixture of disciplinary bias, political obtuseness, ignorance, and haste.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}}}}

[[Max Perutz]], the 1962 Nobel Prize for chemistry winner reached a similar conclusion: {{blockquote|Having been locked up in the Nobel Committee's files these fifty years, the documents leading to this unjust award now reveal that the protracted deliberations by the Nobel jury were hampered by lack of appreciation both of the joint work that had preceded the discovery and of Meitner's written and verbal contributions after her flight from Berlin.{{sfn|Perutz|2002|p=27}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Perutz |first=Max |title=A Passion for Science |newspaper=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=20 February 1997 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/02/20/a-passion-for-science/ |url-access=subscription |access-date=11 July 2020 |archive-date=26 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226124222/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/02/20/a-passion-for-science/ |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

The five-member physics committee included Manne Siegbahn; his former student Erik Hulthén, the professor of experimental physics at [[Uppsala University]]; and Axel Lindh, who eventually succeeded Hulthén. All three were part of the Siegbahn school of X-ray spectroscopy. The poor relationship between Siegbahn and Meitner was a factor here, as was the bias towards experimental rather than theoretical physics.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}}<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/science/lise-meitner-fission-nobel.html | title=Why the 'Mother of the Atomic Bomb' Never Won a Nobel Prize | newspaper=The New York Times | date=2 October 2023 | last1=Miller | first1=Katrina | access-date=8 August 2024 | archive-date=2 October 2023 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20231002171026/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/science/lise-meitner-fission-nobel.html | url-status=live }}</ref> In his report on the work of Meitner and Frisch, Hulthén relied on pre-war papers. He did not think that their work was groundbreaking and argued that the prize for physics was given for experimental rather than theoretical work, which had not been the case for many years.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}}
At the time Meitner herself wrote in a letter: "Surely Hahn fully deserved the Nobel Prize for chemistry. There is really no doubt about it. But I believe that Frisch and I contributed something not insignificant to the clarification of the process of uranium fission—how it originates and that it produces so much energy and that was something very remote to Hahn."{{sfn|Sexl|Hardy|2002|p=119}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=327}} Hahn's Nobel Prize was long expected; both he and Meitner had been nominated for both the chemistry and the physics prizes several times even before the discovery of nuclear fission. According to the Nobel Prize archive, she was nominated 19 times for Nobel Prize in Chemistry between 1924 and 1948, and 30 times for Nobel Prize in Physics between 1937 and 1967. Her nominators included [[Arthur Compton]], Dirk Coster, Kasimir Fajans, James Franck, Otto Hahn, [[Oscar Klein]], Niels Bohr, Max Planck and [[Max Born]].<ref name="Hahn nominations">{{cite web |title=Nomination Database: Otto Hahn |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3787 |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date=9 June 2020 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-date=20 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620174922/https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3787 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Meitner nominations">{{cite web |title=Nomination Database: Lise Meitner |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=6097 |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date=9 June 2020 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612011202/https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=6097 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite not having been awarded the Nobel Prize, Meitner was invited to attend the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lise Meitner – Fame without a Nobel Prize |date=5 November 2015 |first=Stephanie |last=Hanel |publisher=The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings |url=https://www.lindau-nobel.org/lise-meitner-fame-without-a-nobel-prize/ |access-date=11 July 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803121433/https://www.lindau-nobel.org/lise-meitner-fame-without-a-nobel-prize/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Later life==
[[File:Lise Meitner standing at meeting with Arthur H. Compton and Katherine Cornell.jpg|thumb |Meitner with actress [[Katharine Cornell]] and physicist [[Arthur Compton]] on 6 June 1946]]
Meitner found that Siegbahn did not want her. At the time the offer to come to Sweden had been extended, he had said that he had no money, and could only offer Meitner a place to work. Eva von Bahr had then written to [[Carl Wilhelm Oseen]], who had provided money from the Nobel Foundation. This left her with laboratory space, but now she had to perform work that she had been able to delegate to her laboratory technicians for the previous twenty years.{{sfn|Sime|1994|p=697}} Ruth Lewin Sime wrote that: {{blockquote|In Sweden there was no general sympathy for refugees from Nazi Germany: the country was small, with a weak economy and no immigrant tradition, and its academic culture had always been firmly pro-German, a tradition that did not change much until the middle of the war when it became obvious that Germany would not win. During the war, members of Siegbahn's group saw Meitner as an outsider, withdrawn and depressed; they did not understand the displacement and anxiety common to all refugees, or the trauma of losing friends and relatives to the Holocaust, or the exceptional isolation of a woman who had single mindedly devoted her life to her work.{{sfn|Sime|1994|p=697}} }}

On 14 January 1939, Meitner learned that her brother-in-law Jutz had been released from [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and he and her sister Gusti were permitted to emigrate to Sweden.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=247}} Jutz's boss, [[Gottfried Bermann]], had escaped to Sweden,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=247}} and he offered Jutz his old job back at the publishing firm if he was able to come. Niels Bohr interceded with a Swedish official, [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Justitieråd]] Alexandersson, who said that Jutz would receive a labour permit on arrival in Sweden. He worked there until he was pensioned off in 1948, and then moved to Cambridge to join Otto Robert Frisch.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=205–207}} Her sister Gisela and brother-in-law Karl Lion moved to England,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=215}} and Meitner also considered moving there. She visited Cambridge in July 1939 and accepted an offer from [[William Lawrence Bragg]] and [[John Cockcroft]] of a position at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] on a three-year contract with [[Girton College, Cambridge]], but the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939 before she could make the move.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=278}}

In Sweden, Meitner continued her research as best she could. She measured the neutron cross sections of thorium, lead and uranium using [[dysprosium]] as a neutron detector,{{sfn|Sime|1994|p=697}} an assay technique pioneered by George de Hevesy and [[Hilde Levi]].{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=88–90}} She was able to arrange for Hedwig Kohn, who faced deportation to Poland, to come to Sweden, and eventually to emigrate to the United States, travelling via the [[Soviet Union]]. She was unsuccessful in bringing Stefen Meyer out of Germany,{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=285–288}} but he managed to survive the war.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=313}} She declined an offer to join Frisch on the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], declaring "I will have nothing to do with a bomb!"{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=305}} She later said that the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] had come as a surprise to her, and that she was "sorry that the bomb had to be invented".{{sfn|Dawidoff|1994|p=228}} After the war, Meitner acknowledged her own moral failing in staying in Germany from 1933 to 1938. She wrote: "It was not only stupid but very wrong that I did not leave at once."{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=310}} She regretted her own inaction during this period, and was also bitterly critical of Hahn, Max von Laue, [[Werner Heisenberg]], and other German scientists. In a June 1945 letter addressed to Hahn, that he never received, she wrote: {{blockquote|You all worked for Nazi Germany. And you did not even try passive resistance. Granted, to absolve your conscience you helped some oppressed person here and there, but millions of innocent human beings were murdered and there was no protest. Here in neutral Sweden, long before the end of the war, there was discussion of what should be done with German scholars once the war is over. What then must the English and Americans be thinking? I and many others are of the opinion that the one path for you would be to deliver an open statement that you are aware that through your passivity you share responsibility for what has happened, and that you have the need to work for what can be done to make amends. But many think it is too late for that. These people say that first you betrayed your friends, then your men and your children in that you let them stake their lives on a criminal war – and finally that you betrayed Germany itself, because when the war was already quite hopeless, you never once spoke out against the meaningless destruction of Germany. That sounds pitiless but nevertheless I believe that the reason I write this to you is true friendship. In the last few days one had heard of the unbelievably gruesome things in the concentration camps; it overwhelms everything one previously feared. When I heard on English radio a very detailed report by the English and Americans about [[Belsen]] and [[Buchenwald]], I began to cry out loud and lay awake all night. And if you had seen those people who were brought here from the camps. One should take a man like Heisenberg and millions like him, and force them to look at these camps and the martyred people. The way he turned up in Denmark in 1941 is unforgettable.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=310}} }}

In the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima, Meitner became a celebrity. She had a radio interview with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and a few days later another one with a radio station in New York, during which she heard her sister Frida's voice for the first time in years.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=310}} "I am of Jewish descent", she told Frida, "I am not Jewish by belief, know nothing of the history of Judaism, and do not feel closer to Jews than to other people."{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=315–316}} On 25 January 1946, Meitner arrived in New York, where she was greeted by her sisters Lola and Frida, and by Frisch, who had made the two-day train trip from Los Alamos. Lola's husband [[Rudolf Allers]] arranged a visiting professorship for Meitner at the [[Catholic University of America]]. Meitner lectured at [[Princeton University]], [[Harvard University]] and [[Columbia University]], and discussed physics with Albert Einstein, [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], [[Yang Chen-Ning]] and [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]]. She went to [[Durham, North Carolina]] and saw Hertha Sponer and Hedwig Kohn, and spent an evening in Washington, DC, with James Chadwick, who was now the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. She also met the project's director, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie Groves]]. She spoke at [[Smith College]], and went to Chicago, where she met Enrico Fermi, [[Edward Teller]], [[Victor Weisskopf]] and Leo Szilard.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=330–333}} On 8 July, Meitner boarded the {{RMS|Queen Mary||6}} for England, where she met with [[Erwin Schrödinger]], Wolfgang Pauli and Max Born. There were belated celebrations for the 300th birthday of [[Isaac Newton]], but the only German invited to attend was Max Planck.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=334–335}}

[[File:Chemist Lise Meitner with students.jpg|thumb|left|Meitner with students on the steps of the chemistry building at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in April 1959]]
For her friends in Sweden, Siegbahn's opposition to Meitner's Nobel Prize was the final straw, and they resolved to get her a better position. In 1947, Meitner moved to the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (KTH) in Stockholm, where {{ill|Gudmund Borelius|sv}} established a new facility for atomic research. There had been scant nuclear physics research in Sweden, which was blamed on Siegbahn's lack of support for Meitner's work, and now such knowledge seemed vital for Sweden's future. At the KTH, Meitner had three rooms, two assistants, and access to technicians, with the [[Sigvard Eklund]] occupying the room next door. The intention was that Meitner would have the salary and title of a "research professor"—one without teaching duties.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=347–348}}

The professorship fell through when the [[Ministry of Education and Research (Sweden)|Minister for Education]], [[Tage Erlander]], unexpectedly became the [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] in 1946, but Borelius and Klein ensured that she had the salary of a professor, if not the title.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=358–361}} In 1949, she became a Swedish citizen, but without surrendering her Austrian citizenship thanks to a special act passed by the [[Riksdag]]. Plans were approved for [[R1 (nuclear reactor)|R1]], Sweden's first nuclear reactor, in 1947, with Eklund as the project director, and Meitner worked with him on its design and construction. In her last scientific papers in 1950 and 1951, she applied [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] to nuclear fission.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=358–361}} She retired in 1960 and moved to the UK where many of her relatives were.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Richard |last=Webb |title=Lise Meitner – Physicist who co-discovered nuclear fission |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/people/lise-meitner/ |access-date=9 July 2024 |archive-date=10 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240810020812/https://www.newscientist.com/people/lise-meitner/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 1950s and 1960s, Meitner enjoyed visiting Germany and staying with Hahn and his family for several days on different occasions.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=365}} Hahn wrote in his memoirs that he and Meitner had remained lifelong close friends.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=51}} Even though their friendship was full of trials, arguably more so experienced by Meitner, she "never voiced anything but deep affection for Hahn".{{sfn|Cropper|2004|p=343}} On occasions such as their 70th, 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays, they addressed recollections in each other's honour. Hahn emphasised Meitner's intellectual productivity, and work such as her research on the nuclear shell model, always passing over the reasons for her move to Sweden as quickly as possible. She emphasised Hahn's personal qualities, his charm and musical ability.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=365}}

[[File:Lise Meitner Grave.jpg|thumb|Meitner's grave in [[Bramley, Hampshire]]]]
A strenuous trip to the United States in 1964 led to Meitner having a heart attack, which she spent several months recovering from. Her physical and mental condition was weakened by [[atherosclerosis]]. After breaking her hip in a fall and suffering several small strokes in 1967, Meitner made a partial recovery, but was eventually weakened to the point where she had to move into a Cambridge nursing home.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=379}} Meitner died in her sleep on 27 October 1968 at the age of 89. She was not informed of the deaths of Otto Hahn on 28 July 1968 or his wife Edith on 14 August, as her family believed it would be too much for someone so frail.<ref name="nytobit">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/28/archives/lise-meitner-dies-atomic-pioneer-89-lise-meitner-physicist-is-dead.html|title=Lise Meitner Dies; Atomic Pioneer, 89.

In 1993, the three co-founders envisioned  graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods.<ref name="fortune-interview-2017" /> As Huang later explained: "We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume.

During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future.<ref name="Tilley" />  Only two survived: Nvidia and [[ATI Technologies]], the latter of which merged into AMD.<ref name="Tilley" />

Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in "next version".<ref name="fortune-interview-2017" /> The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters.<ref name="fortune-interview-2017" />  At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper.<ref name="Witt" /> Huang suggested the name Nvidia,<ref name="Witt" /> from "[[invidia]]", the Latin word for "envy".<ref name="fortune-interview-2017" /> The company's original headquarters office was in [[Sunnyvale, California]].<ref name="fortune-interview-2017" />

=== First graphics accelerator ===
Nvidia's first graphics accelerator, the [[NV1]], was designed to process [[quadrilateral]] [[Geometric primitive|primitives]] ([[forward texture mapping]]), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.<ref name="Witt" /> However, when [[Microsoft]] introduced the [[DirectX]] platform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its [[Direct3D]] API would exclusively support triangles.<ref name="Witt" /><ref name="Peddie">{{cite news |last1=Peddie |first1=Jon |date=September 23, 2019 |title=Nvidia's RIVA 128 |url=https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded/article/21131077/jon-peddie-research-nvidias-riva-128 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240119155034/https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded/article/21131077/jon-peddie-research-nvidias-riva-128 |archive-date=January 19, 2024 |access-date=December 5, 2023 |work=Electronic Design}}</ref> As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kim |first=Tae |title=The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant |date=2024 |publisher=W.

Nvidia had also entered into a partnership with [[Sega]] to supply the graphics chip for the [[Dreamcast]] console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia's technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.<ref name="wsj cohen 2024">{{Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Ben |date=May 18, 2024 |title=The 84-Year-Old Man Who Saved Nvidia |url=https://www.wsj.com/business/nvidia-stock-jensen-huang-sega-irimajiri-chips-ai-906247db |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240518101129/https://www.wsj.com/business/nvidia-stock-jensen-huang-sega-irimajiri-chips-ai-906247db |archive-date=May 18, 2024 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

In a pivotal moment, Sega's president, [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]], visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia's potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri's "understanding and generosity gave us six months to live".<ref name="wsj cohen 2024" />

In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the [[RIVA 128]].<ref name="Witt" /><ref name="Peddie" />  By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll.<ref name="Witt" /> The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia's unofficial company motto: "Our company is thirty days from going out of business."<ref name="Witt" /> Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.<ref name="Witt" />

Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,<ref name="Witt" /> and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products.<ref name="Peddie" /> In 1998, the release of the [[RIVA TNT]] helped solidify Nvidia’s reputation as a leader in graphics technology.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fulton |first=Kane |date=2015-07-20 |title=19 graphics cards that shaped the future of gaming |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/19-graphics-cards-that-shaped-the-future-of-gaming-1289666 |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=TechRadar |language=en}}</ref>

After Irimajiri left Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.<ref name="wsj cohen 2024" />

In late 1999, Nvidia released the [[GeForce 256]] (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|transformation and lighting]] (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120&nbsp;MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.

Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the [[GeForce 2 Series|GeForce2 GTS]] shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival [[3dfx Interactive|3dfx]], a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=NVIDIA to Acquire 3dfx Core Graphics Assets |date=December 15, 2000 |location=Santa Clara, CA |url=https://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_20010612_6602.html |last1=Perez |first1=Derek |last2=Hara |first2=Michael |access-date=January 23, 2017 |archive-date=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330171444/https://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_20010612_6602.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release |title=3dfx Announces Three Major Initiatives To Protect Creditors and Maximize Shareholder Value |date=December 15, 2000 |location=San Jose, CA |url=http://3dfx.com/rel-15dec_2.htm |quote=Board of Directors Initiates Cost-Cutting Measures, Recommends to Shareholders Sale of Company Assets to NVIDIA Corporation for $112 million and Dissolution of Company |last1=Leupp |first1=Alex |last2=Sellers |first2=Scott |access-date=January 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010205193000/http://3dfx.com/rel-15dec_2.htm |archive-date=February 5, 2001 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kanellos |first=Michael |date=April 11, 2002 |title=Nvidia buys out 3dfx graphics chip business |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-buys-out-3dfx-graphics-chip-business/ |access-date=January 23, 2017 |website=[[CNET]] |archive-date=January 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119063532/https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-buys-out-3dfx-graphics-chip-business/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Open-source software support ==
{{See also|Free and open-source graphics device driver|Mesa 3D|nouveau (software)|OpenPOWER Foundation}}
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its advanced hardware,<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 23, 2013 |title=Nvidia Offers to Release Public Documentation on Certain Aspects of Their GPUs |url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2013-September/014480.html |access-date=September 24, 2013 |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112013329/https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2013-September/014480.html |url-status=live}}</ref> meaning that programmers could not write [[free and open-source]] [[device driver]] for its products without resorting to [[reverse engineering]].

Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] and an open-source library that interfaces with the [[Linux kernel|Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] or [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.<ref>{{Cite web |title=nv |url=http://www.x.org/wiki/nv |access-date=August 6, 2015 |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021514/https://www.x.org/wiki/nv/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job. They have created a system that, after a short revision and testing, can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation. In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications.<ref>[https://newatlas.com/robot-learn-watching-humans/54732/ "Robot see, robot do: Nvidia system lets robots learn by watching humans"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109004513/https://newatlas.com/robot-learn-watching-humans/54732/ |date=November 9, 2020 }} ''New Atlas'', May 23, 2018</ref>

=== GTX 970 hardware specifications ===
Issues with the GeForce GTX 970's specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards, while featuring 4&nbsp;GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5&nbsp;GB boundary. Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card's initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5&nbsp;GB limit were put into use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Graphics-Cards/NVIDIA-Discloses-Full-Memory-Structure-and-Limitations-GTX-970 |title=NVIDIA Discloses Full Memory Structure and Limitations of GTX 970 |publisher=PCPer|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225180420/http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Graphics-Cards/NVIDIA-Discloses-Full-Memory-Structure-and-Limitations-GTX-970|archive-date=February 25, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-970-memory-issue-fully-explained/ |title=GeForce GTX 970 Memory Issue Fully Explained – Nvidia's Response |date=January 24, 2015 |publisher=WCFTech|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=March 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307020110/http://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-970-memory-issue-fully-explained/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/why-nvidias-gtx-970-slows-down-using-more-than-35gb-vram/ |title=Why Nvidia's GTX 970 slows down when using more than 3.5GB VRAM |date=January 26, 2015 |publisher=PCGamer|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=March 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302151518/http://www.pcgamer.com/why-nvidias-gtx-970-slows-down-using-more-than-35gb-vram/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The card's back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75&nbsp;MB versus 2&nbsp;MB in the GeForce GTX 980) and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a 3.5&nbsp;GB section, plus a 0.5&nbsp;GB one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8935/geforce-gtx-970-correcting-the-specs-exploring-memory-allocation |title=GeForce GTX 970: Correcting The Specs & Exploring Memory Allocation |publisher=AnandTech|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=February 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225183034/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8935/geforce-gtx-970-correcting-the-specs-exploring-memory-allocation|url-status=live}}</ref> The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wccftech.com/nvidia-working-driver-geforce-gtx-970-tune-memory-allocation-problems-improve-performance/ |title=NVIDIA Working on New Driver For GeForce GTX 970 To Tune Memory Allocation Problems and Improve Performance |date=January 28, 2015 |publisher=WCFTech|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=February 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061234/http://wccftech.com/nvidia-working-driver-geforce-gtx-970-tune-memory-allocation-problems-improve-performance/|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX 970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2876802/nvidia-plans-geforce-gtx-970-driver-update-for-memory-performance-concerns.html/ |title=NVIDIA clarifies no driver update for GTX 970 specifically |date=January 29, 2015 |publisher=PC World|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=August 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830210733/https://www.pcworld.com/article/2876802/nvidia-plans-geforce-gtx-970-driver-update-for-memory-performance-concerns.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcper.com/news/Graphics-Cards/NVIDIA-Plans-Driver-Update-GTX-970-Memory-Issue-Help-Returns |title=NVIDIA Plans Driver Update for GTX 970 Memory Issue, Help with Returns |work=pcper.com |date=January 28, 2015|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=February 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214101918/http://www.pcper.com/news/Graphics-Cards/NVIDIA-Plans-Driver-Update-GTX-970-Memory-Issue-Help-Returns|url-status=live}}</ref> On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia's official blog to apologize for the incident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-ceo-addresses-gtx-970-controversy/ |title=Nvidia CEO addresses GTX 970 controversy |publisher=PCGamer |date=February 26, 2015|access-date=August 16, 2021|archive-date=February 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227104339/http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-ceo-addresses-gtx-970-controversy/|url-status=live}}</ref> In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern California.<ref name="970lawsuit">{{cite news |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-faces-false-advertising-lawsuit-over-gtx-970-specs/ |title=Nvidia faces false advertising lawsuit over GTX 970 specs |last=Chalk |first=Andy |date=February 22, 2015 |work=PC Gamer|access-date=March 27, 2015|archive-date=March 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324202726/http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-faces-false-advertising-lawsuit-over-gtx-970-specs/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2887234/nvidia-hit-with-false-advertising-suit-over-gtx-970-performance.html |title=Nvidia hit with false advertising suit over GTX 970 performance |last=Niccolai |first=James |date=February 20, 2015 |work=PC World|access-date=March 27, 2015|archive-date=March 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326052210/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2887234/nvidia-hit-with-false-advertising-suit-over-gtx-970-performance.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,<ref name="970lawsuit" /> offering a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases.

=== Improper disclosures about cryptomining ===
In 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for [[cryptomining]], the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a "significant element" of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order. Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the findings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC in May 2022.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Prentice |first1=Chris |last2=Singh |first2=Kanishka |date=May 6, 2022 |title=Nvidia to pay $5.5 million penalty for 'inadequate disclosures' about cryptomining |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-charges-nvidia-with-inadequate-disclosures-about-impact-cryptomining-2022-05-06/ |access-date=May 7, 2022 |archive-date=May 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220507154409/https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-charges-nvidia-with-inadequate-disclosures-about-impact-cryptomining-2022-05-06/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

'''The Beatles''' were<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in each of American, Canadian and British English. Please do not change "were" to "was". See Talk:The_Beach_Boys/Archive_2#Singular_or_Plural--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1960. The core lineup of the band comprised [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. They are widely regarded as the [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|most influential band]] in Western [[popular music]] and were integral to the development of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and the recognition of popular music as an art form.{{sfn|Hasted|2017|p=425}}{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}} Rooted in [[skiffle]], [[beat music|beat]] and 1950s [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]], their sound incorporated elements of [[classical music]] and [[traditional pop]] in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]] to [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]]. As [[Recording practices of the Beatles|pioneers in recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}

Led by primary songwriters [[Lennon–McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, [[the Quarrymen]], and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]], Germany, starting in 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act, and producer [[George Martin]] developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with [[EMI]] and achieved their first hit, "[[Love Me Do]]", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "[[Beatlemania]]", the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four". Epstein, Martin or other members of the band's entourage were sometimes informally referred to as a "[[fifth Beatle]]".

By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the [[British Invasion]] of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced albums of greater sophistication, including ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967). They enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as "the White Album", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). The success of these records heralded the [[album era]], increased public interest in [[psychedelic drug]]s and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in [[electronic music]], [[album art]] and [[music video]]s. In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists, and some [[Collaborations between ex-Beatles|partial reunions]] occurred. Lennon [[Murder of John Lennon|was murdered]] in 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.

They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility, 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s lists of [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|the greatest artists in history]].

=== 1956–1963: Formation ===
<!-- Please be aware that various former names of the Beatles redirect to {{anchor|Formation}}. -->

==== The Quarrymen and name changes ====
{{Main|The Quarrymen}}
In November 1956, sixteen-year-old [[John Lennon]] formed a [[skiffle]] group with several friends from [[Calderstones School|Quarry Bank High School]] in [[Liverpool]]. They were called ''[[the Quarrymen]]'', a reference to their school song "Quarry men old before our birth".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=104}} Fifteen-year-old [[Paul McCartney]] met Lennon on 6 July 1957 and joined as a [[rhythm guitar]]ist shortly after.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93–99}} In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend [[George Harrison]], then aged fifteen, to watch the band. Harrison auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young. After a month's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), Harrison performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song "[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.</ref> and they enlisted him as [[lead guitar]]ist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}}

By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group and he began his studies at the [[Liverpool College of Art]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=103}} The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=17}} were playing [[rock and roll]] whenever they could find a drummer.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=742–743}} They also performed as ''the Rainbows''. Paul McCartney later told ''New Musical Express'' that they called themselves that "because we all had different coloured shirts and we couldn't afford any others!"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Alan |title=The Beatles, Paul McCartney: Close-Up on Paul McCartney, a Beatle |work=New Musical Express |publisher=NME Networks |date=9 August 1963 |location=London, England}}</ref>

Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to ''Beatals'', as a tribute to [[Buddy Holly]] and [[the Crickets]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Gilliland| 1969|loc=show 27, track 4}} They used this name until May, when they became ''the Silver Beetles'', before undertaking a brief [[The Beat Ballad Show Tour|tour of Scotland]] as the backing group for pop singer and fellow [[Liverpudlian]] [[Johnny Gentle]]. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as ''the Silver Beatles'' and by the middle of August simply ''the Beatles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18–22}}

==== Early residencies and UK popularity ====
[[Allan Williams]], the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a [[The Beatles in Hamburg|residency for them in Hamburg]]. They auditioned and hired drummer [[Pete Best]] in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed Liverpool for Hamburg four days later, contracted to club owner [[Bruno Koschmider]] for what would be a 3½ -month residency.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=21–25}} Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] writes: "They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the [[Reeperbahn|red-light area]] comes to life&nbsp;... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities."{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=22}}

Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the [[Red-light district|Red light]] [[Reeperbahn]] district of [[St. Pauli]] into music venues and initially placed the Beatles at the [[The Beatles in Hamburg#The Indra and Kaiserkeller|Indra Club]]. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the [[Kaiserkeller]] in October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=23}} When he learned they had been performing at the rival [[Top Ten Club]] in breach of their contract, he gave them one month's termination notice,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24, 33}} and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=88}} The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=24}} One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24–25}} Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée [[Astrid Kirchherr]],{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=25}} who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=222–224}}

During the next two&nbsp;years, the Beatles were 
[[The Beatles in Hamburg|resident for periods in Hamburg]], where they used [[Phenmetrazine|Preludin]] both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66–67}} In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the "[[exi (subculture)|exi]]" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=76}} Later on, Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany. McCartney took over bass.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=89, 94}} Producer [[Bert Kaempfert]] contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as [[Tony Sheridan]]'s [[backup band|backing band]] on a series of recordings for [[Polydor Records]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 27, track 4}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=249–251}} As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one&nbsp;year.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=450}} Credited to "Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers", the single "[[My Bonnie]]", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the ''[[Musikmarkt]]'' chart.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=100}}

After the Beatles completed their second [[The Beatles in Hamburg|Hamburg residency]], they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing [[beat music|Merseybeat]] movement. However, they were growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=33}} In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at [[the Cavern Club]], they encountered [[Brian Epstein]], a local record-store owner and music columnist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84–87}} He later recalled: "I immediately liked what I heard.

Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84–88}} Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month early release in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=10}} On their return to Germany in April, a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from a [[intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}} Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=612, 629}} After a New Year's Day audition, [[The Beatles' Decca audition|Decca Records rejected the band]], saying, "Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} However, three months later, producer [[George Martin]] signed the Beatles to [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] label.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}}

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Recording Studios]] (later Abbey Road Studios) in London on 6 June 1962.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}} He immediately complained to Epstein about Best's drumming and suggested they use a [[session musician|session drummer]] in his place.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=318, 322}} Already contemplating Best's dismissal,{{sfn|Miles|1998|pp=49–50}} the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with [[Ringo Starr]], who left [[Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]] to join them.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}} A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of "[[Love Me Do]]" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of "Love Me Do", "[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]" and "[[P.S. I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}}

Martin initially selected the Starr version of "Love Me Do" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}} Released in early October, "Love Me Do" peaked at number seventeen on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=59–60}} Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme ''[[Granada Reports|People and Places]]''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=81, 355}} After Martin suggested rerecording "Please Please Me" at a faster tempo,{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=90}} a studio session in late November yielded that recording,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=62, 84}} of which Martin accurately predicted, "You've just made your first No.&nbsp;1".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=875}}

In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency at the [[Star-Club]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=62, 86}} By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=191}} Lennon and McCartney had established [[Lennon–McCartney|a songwriting partnership]], and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a [[lead vocalist]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=494}} Epstein, to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=128, 133–134}} Lennon recalled him saying, "Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change&nbsp;– stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking&nbsp;...".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon said of Epstein, "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage.

On 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP, ''[[Please Please Me]]''. It was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin considered recording the LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a "live" album with minimal production in "a single marathon session at Abbey Road".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=147}} After the moderate success of "Love Me Do", the single "Please Please Me" was released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album. It reached number one on every UK chart except ''Record Retailer'', where it peaked at number two.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=88, 351}}

Recalling how the Beatles "rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out ''Please Please Me'' in a day", [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote: "Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins."<ref name="Please Please Me AllMusic">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=''Please Please Me'' – The Beatles |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/please-please-me-mw0000649873 |access-date=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202703/http://www.allmusic.com/album/please-please-me-mw0000649873 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were "just writing songs ''à la'' [[The Everly Brothers|Everly Brothers]], ''à la'' Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought of them than that&nbsp;– to create a sound.

Released in March 1963, ''Please Please Me'' was the first of eleven consecutive Beatles albums released in the United Kingdom to reach number one.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=90, 351}} The band's third single, "[[From Me to You]]", came out in April and began an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number-one singles, including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six&nbsp;years.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=89, 350–351}} Issued in August, their fourth single, "[[She Loves You]]", achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time, selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=159}} It became their first single to sell a million copies and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=990}}{{refn|group=nb|"She Loves You" was surpassed in sales by "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]", by McCartney's post-Beatles band [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=990}}}}

The success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=166–169}} The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May–June.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=90, 98–105, 109–112}} As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold.

In late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1088}} On their return to the UK on 31 October, several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at [[Heathrow Airport]]. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers, as well as representatives from the [[BBC Television|BBC]], also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=92–93}} The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=127–133}} In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.{{sfn|Davies|1968|pp=184–185}} On 4 November, they played in front of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|The Queen Mother]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] during the [[List of Royal Variety Performances#1960s|Royal Variety Performance]] at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]].{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=111}}

''Please Please Me'' maintained the top position on the ''Record Retailer'' chart for 30 weeks, only to be displaced by its follow-up, ''[[With the Beatles]]'',{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=90, 92, 100}} which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies.

In a reversal of then standard practice, EMI released the album ahead of the impending single "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]", with the song excluded to maximise the single's sales.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=187–188}} The album caught the attention of music critic [[William Mann (critic)|William Mann]] of ''[[The Times]]'', who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were "the outstanding English composers of 1963".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=187}} The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music, lending it respectability.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1162}} ''With the Beatles'' became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies, a figure previously reached only by the 1958 [[South Pacific (soundtrack)|''South Pacific'' soundtrack]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=978}} When writing the [[liner notes|sleeve notes]] for the album, the band's press officer, [[Tony Barrow]], used the superlative the "fabulous foursome", which the media widely adopted as "the Fab Four".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=402}}

EMI's American subsidiary, [[Capitol Records]], hindered the Beatles' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music, including their first three singles. Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label [[Vee-Jay]] led to the release of some, but not all, of the songs in 1963.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=350}} Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album ''[[Introducing...

Epstein brought a demo copy of "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]" to Capitol's [[Brown Meggs]], who signed the band and arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station [[WQOF|WWDC]], in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the British single "I Want to Hold Your Hand" in mid-December 1963 and began playing it on-air.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vries |first=Lloyd |title=Beatles' 'Helping Hand' Shuns Fame |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=16 January 2004 |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/beatles-helping-hand-shuns-fame/|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806140924/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/beatles-helping-hand-shuns-fame/|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Taped copies of the song soon circulated among other radio stations throughout the US.

Capitol Records' lack of interest throughout 1963 did not go unnoticed, and a competitor, [[United Artists Records]], encouraged [[United Artists|its film division]] to offer the Beatles a three-motion-picture deal, primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks in the US.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=483–484}} Directed by [[Richard Lester]], ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' involved the band for six weeks in March–April 1964 as they played themselves in a musical comedy.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=230–232}} The film premiered in London and New York in July and August, respectively, and was an international success, with some critics drawing a comparison with the [[Marx Brothers]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=489–490}}

United Artists released a [[A Hard Day's Night (album)#North American release|full soundtrack album]] for the North American market, combining Beatles songs and Martin's orchestral score; elsewhere, the group's third studio LP, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', contained songs from the film on side one and other new recordings on side two.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=47}} According to Erlewine, the album saw them "truly coming into their own as a band.

In August, journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] arranged for the Beatles to meet [[Bob Dylan]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=252}} Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=185}} Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were "perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds": Dylan's audience of "college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly [[bohemian style]]" contrasted with their fans, "veritable '[[teenybopper]]s' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the [[folk music]] scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists."{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=252–253}}

Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, "Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and [[Electric Dylan controversy|electric instrumentation]], and "dressed in the height of Mod fashion".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=253}} As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts "nearly evaporated", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=253}}

==== ''Beatles for Sale'', ''Help!'' and ''Rubber Soul'' ====
According to Gould, the Beatles' fourth studio LP, ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'', evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=255–256}} They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=167–176}} to continue the format established by ''A Hard Day's Night'' which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=255–256}} They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, "Material's becoming a hell of a problem".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=256}} As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album. Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] songwriting partnership.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=255–256}}

In early 1965, following a dinner with Lennon, Harrison and their wives, Harrison's dentist, John Riley, secretly added [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to their coffee.<ref>{{cite news |last=Herbert |first=Ian |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/revealed-dentist-who-introduced-beatles-to-lsd-6231654.html |title=Revealed: Dentist who introduced Beatles to LSD |date=9 September 2006 |work=The Independent|access-date=13 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513223841/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/revealed-dentist-who-introduced-beatles-to-lsd-6231654.html|archive-date=13 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Lennon described the experience: "It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned for a month or two."{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=316}} He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. Harrison's use of [[psychedelic drug]]s encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]], it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realised a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them.

Controversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen [[Elizabeth II]] appointed all four Beatles Members of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) after Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] nominated them for the award.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=556}} In protest – the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their insignia.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=557}}

In July, the Beatles' second film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', was released, again directed by Lester. Described as "mainly a relentless spoof of [[Production of the James Bond films|Bond]]",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=275}} it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: "''Help!'' was great but it wasn't our film&nbsp;– we were sort of guest stars. It was fun, but basically, as an idea for a film, it was a bit wrong."{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=274}} The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]" and "[[Ticket to Ride (song)|Ticket to Ride]]".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=276–277}}

The ''[[Help!]]'' album, the group's fifth studio LP, mirrored ''A Hard Day's Night'' by featuring soundtrack songs on side one and additional songs from the same sessions on side two.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=62}} The LP contained all original material save for two covers, "[[Act Naturally]]" and "[[Dizzy, Miss Lizzy|Dizzy Miss Lizzy]]"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album until ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]''{{'s}} brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song "[[Maggie May (folk song)|Maggie Mae]]".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=276–280}} The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on ''Help!'' and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Gould|1y=2007|1pp=290–292|2a1=Lewisohn|2y=1988|2pp=59, 62}} Composed and sung by McCartney – none of the other Beatles perform on the recording{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=59}} – "Yesterday" has inspired the most cover versions of any song ever written.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schaal |first=Eric |date=29 June 2019 |title=Is The Beatles' 'Yesterday' Really the Most-Covered Song of All Time? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/is-the-beatles-yesterday-really-the-most-covered-song-of-all-time.html/ |access-date=6 January 2020 |website=Cheatsheet |archive-date=7 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507104239/https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/is-the-beatles-yesterday-really-the-most-covered-song-of-all-time.html/ |url-status=live}}</ref> With ''Help!'', the Beatles became the first rock group to be nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newsweek.com/grammy-awards-album-year-winners-steely-dan-426569 |first=Zach |last=Schonfeld |title=The Most Ridiculous 'Album of the Year' Winners in Grammy History |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=15 February 2016|access-date=24 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108065752/https://www.newsweek.com/grammy-awards-album-year-winners-steely-dan-426569|archive-date=8 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In mid-October, the Beatles entered the recording studio; for the first time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=202}} Until this time, according to George Martin, "we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles.

While some of ''Rubber Soul''{{'}}s songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting,{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=584–592}} the album also included distinct compositions from each,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=268, 276, 278–279}} though they continued to share official credit.

==== Controversies, ''Revolver'' and final tour ====
Capitol Records, from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market, exercised complete control over format,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=350}} compiling distinct US albums from the band's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=295–296}}{{refn|group=nb|It was not until ''[[Sgt.

Released in August 1966, a week before the Beatles' final tour, ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' marked another artistic step forward for the group.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} The album featured sophisticated songwriting, studio experimentation and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles, ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} Abandoning the customary group photograph, its [[Aubrey Beardsley]]-inspired cover – designed by [[Klaus Voormann]], a friend of the band since their Hamburg days – was a monochrome collage and line drawing caricature of the group.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} The album was preceded by the single "[[Paperback Writer]]", backed by "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} Short promotional films were made for both songs; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as "among the first true music videos",{{sfn|Austerlitz|2007|p=18}} they aired on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in June.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=221–222}}

Among the experimental songs on ''Revolver'' was "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from [[Timothy Leary]]'s ''[[The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''. Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a [[tape loop]] while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=364–366}} McCartney's "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" made prominent use of a [[octet (music)|string octet]]; Gould describes it as "a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=350, 402}} Harrison's emergence as a songwriter was reflected in three of his compositions appearing on the record.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=63}} Among these, "[[Taxman]]", which opened the album, marked the first example of the Beatles making a political statement through their music.{{sfn|Turner|2016|p=162}}

As preparations were made for a tour of the US, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used [[Vox AC30]] amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed for them by [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]], as they moved into larger venues in 1964; however, these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1093}} Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=210, 230}}

The band performed none of their new songs on the tour.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=361–365}} In Chris Ingham's description, they were very much "studio creations&nbsp;... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts."{{sfn|Ingham|2006|p=44}} The band's concert at San Francisco's [[Candlestick Park]] on 29 August was their last commercial concert.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=293–295}} It marked the end of four&nbsp;years dominated by almost non-stop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=5–6, 249, 281, 347}}

Freed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded ''[[Sgt.

We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around."{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=387–388}} Parts of "[[A Day in the Life]]" featured a 40-piece orchestra.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=387–388}} The sessions initially yielded the non-album [[double A-side]] single "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]"/"[[Penny Lane]]" in February 1967;{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=221}} the ''Sgt.

{{blockquote|The overwhelming consensus is that the Beatles had created a popular masterpiece: a rich, sustained, and overflowing work of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular music on record could be. On the basis of this perception, ''Sgt. Pepper'' became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionise both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=418}}}}

==== ''Magical Mystery Tour'' and ''Yellow Submarine'' ====
{{Main|Magical Mystery Tour (film){{!}}''Magical Mystery Tour'' (film)|Yellow Submarine (film){{!}}''Yellow Submarine'' (film)}}
Two Beatles film projects were conceived within weeks of completing ''Sgt. Pepper'': ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', a one-hour television film, and ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', an animated feature-length film produced by [[United Artists]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=41, 110–111, 122}} The group began recording music for the former in late April 1967, but the project then lay dormant as they focused on recording songs for the latter.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=276–77}} On 25 June, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single "[[All You Need Is Love]]" to an estimated 350&nbsp;million viewers on ''[[Our World (1967 TV program)|Our World]]'', the first live global television link.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=237, 259–260}} Released a week later, during the [[Summer of Love]], the song was adopted as a [[flower power]] anthem.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=428–429}} The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs was at its height during that summer.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=129}} In July and August, the group pursued interests related to similar utopian-based ideology, including a week-long investigation into the possibility of starting an island-based [[Intentional community|commune]] off the coast of Greece.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=197}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Knott |first=Jonathan |date=9 September 2023 |title='Used as propaganda': the Beatles' Greek island plans and international politics |journal=Journal of Beatles Studies |language=en |volume=2023 |issue=Spring/Autumn |pages=109–141 |doi=10.3828/jbs.2023.7 |s2cid=261671152 |issn=2754-7019 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

On 24 August, the group were introduced to [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in London. The next day, they travelled to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] for his [[Transcendental Meditation]] retreat. On 27 August, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein had died.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=709, 713–719}} The coroner ruled the death an accidental [[Bromoureide|carbitol]] overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=249}}{{refn|group=nb|Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal troubles. It was speculated that he was concerned that the band might not renew his management contract, due to expire in October, over discontent with his supervision of business matters, particularly regarding [[Seltaeb]], the company that handled their US merchandising rights.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|pp=227–228}}}} His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=268}} Lennon recalled: "We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've fuckin' had it now.{{' "}}{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=508}} Harrison's then-wife [[Pattie Boyd]] remembered that "Paul and George were in complete shock. I don't think it could have been worse if they had heard that their own fathers had dropped dead."{{sfn|Boyd|2008|pp=106–107}} During a band meeting in September, McCartney recommended that the band proceed with ''Magical Mystery Tour''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=276–77}}

The [[Magical Mystery Tour|''Magical Mystery Tour'' soundtrack]] was released in the UK as a six-track double [[extended play]] (EP) in early December 1967.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=350}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=452}} It was the first example of a double EP in the UK.{{sfn|Neaverson|1997|p=53}}{{sfn|Larkin|2006|p=488}} The record carried on the psychedelic vein of ''Sgt.

Pepper''.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=452}} In the US, the soundtrack appeared as an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=351}} In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP and is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=699}}

''Magical Mystery Tour'' first aired on [[Boxing Day]] to an audience of approximately 15&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=90}} Largely directed by McCartney, the film was the band's first critical failure in the UK.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=368–69}} It was dismissed as "blatant rubbish" by the ''[[Daily Express]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' called it "a colossal conceit" and ''[[The Guardian]]'' labelled the film "a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=455–456}} Gould describes it as "a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=455–456}} Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=703}}

The group were less involved with ''Yellow Submarine'', which featured the band appearing as themselves for only a short live-action segment.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=276}} Premiering in July 1968, the film featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=485}} Critics praised the film for its music, humour and innovative visual style.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=487–88, 505–506}} A [[Yellow Submarine (album)|soundtrack LP]] was issued seven months later; it contained those four new songs, the title track (already issued on ''Revolver''), "All You Need Is Love" (already issued as a single and on the US ''Magical Mystery Tour'' LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=304, 350}}

==== India retreat, Apple Corps and the White Album ====
{{Main|Beatles in India|Apple Corps|The Beatles (album){{!}}''The Beatles'' (album)}}
In February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]], India, to take part in a three-month meditation "Guide Course". Their [[The Beatles in India|time in India]] marked one of the band's most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs, including a majority of those on their next album.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=108–109}} However, Starr left after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=463–468}} For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to question when an electronics technician known as [[Magic Alex]] suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=705–706}} When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=463–468}} In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled "Maharishi", renamed "[[Sexy Sadie]]" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, "We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was."{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=705–706}}

In May, Lennon and McCartney travelled to New York for the public unveiling of the Beatles' new business venture, [[Apple Corps]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=282}} It was initially formed several months earlier as part of a plan to create a tax-effective business structure, but the band then desired to extend the corporation to other pursuits, including record distribution, peace activism and education.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=20, 26}} McCartney described Apple as "rather like a Western communism".{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=26}} The enterprise drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=280–281}} handled largely by members of the Beatles' entourage, who were given their jobs regardless of talent and experience.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=22}} Among its numerous subsidiaries were [[Apple Electronics]], established to foster technological innovations with Magic Alex at the head, and Apple Retailing, which opened the short-lived [[Apple Boutique]] in London.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=20, 22, 25, 35}} Harrison later said, "Basically, it was chaos&nbsp;... John and Paul got carried away with the idea and blew millions, and Ringo and I just had to go along with it."{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=26}}

[[File:TheBeatles68LP.jpg|thumb|alt=The album artwork of the Beatles' self-titled 1968 album, also known as "the White Album"|''The Beatles'', known as "the White Album" for its minimalist cover, conceived by pop artist [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] "in direct contrast to ''Sgt. Pepper''", while also suggesting a "clean slate".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=510–511}}]]

From late May to mid-October 1968, the group recorded what became ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', a double LP commonly known as "the White Album" for its virtually featureless cover.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=510}} During this time, relations between the members grew openly divisive.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=310}} Starr quit for two weeks, leaving his bandmates to record "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]" and "[[Dear Prudence]]" as a trio, with McCartney filling in on drums.{{sfn|Winn|2009|pp=205–207}} Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney,{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=513, 516}} whose contribution "[[Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da]]" he scorned as "granny music shit".{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=246}} Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with [[avant-garde]] artist [[Yoko Ono]], whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=103}} McCartney has recalled that the album "wasn't a pleasant one to make".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=310}} He and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band's break-up.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=237}}{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=102}}

With the record, the band executed a wider range of musical styles{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=315}} and broke with their recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Faust |first1=Edwin |title=On Second Thought: The Beatles – The Beatles |url=http://stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beatles-the-beatles.htm |website=Stylus Magazine|access-date=18 December 2016 |date=1 September 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223025212/http://stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beatles-the-beatles.htm|archive-date=23 December 2008}}</ref> During the sessions, the group upgraded to an eight-track tape console, which made it easier for them to layer tracks piecemeal, while the members often recorded independently of each other, affording the album a reputation as a collection of solo recordings rather than a unified group effort.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=137, 146, 150, 152}} Describing the double album, Lennon later said: "Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band."{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=509}} The sessions also produced the Beatles' longest song yet, "[[Hey Jude]]", released in August as a non-album single with "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=152}}

Issued in November, the White Album was the band's first [[Apple Records]] album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=278}} The record attracted more than 2&nbsp;million advance orders, selling nearly 4&nbsp;million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=528}} Its lyrical content was the focus of much analysis by the counterculture.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=311–313}} Despite its popularity, reviewers were largely confused by the album's content and it failed to inspire the level of critical writing that ''Sgt. Pepper'' had.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=528}}

==== ''Abbey Road'', ''Let It Be'' and separation ====
{{See also|Break-up of the Beatles}}
Although ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before ''[[Abbey Road]]''. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they "record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}} Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called ''Beatles at Work'', in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=306–307}} Martin said that the project was "not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}} Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as "hell&nbsp;... the most miserable&nbsp;... on Earth", and Harrison, "the low of all-time".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=310}} Irritated by McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they "abandon[ed] all talk of live performance" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled ''Get Back'', using songs recorded for the TV special.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=307}} He also demanded they cease work at [[Twickenham Film Studios]], where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished [[Apple Studios (recording studio)|Apple Studio]]. His bandmates agreed and it was decided to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=306–307, 309}}

[[File:Billy Preston perforning in 1971.jpg|alt=American musician Billy Preston in 1971|thumb|left|The American soul musician [[Billy Preston]] (pictured in 1971) was, for a short time, considered a [[fifth Beatle]] during the ''Get Back'' sessions.]]

To alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist [[Billy Preston]] to participate in the last nine days of sessions.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=309–314}} Preston received label billing on the "[[Get Back]]" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=451, 660}} After the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Libyan desert and the [[Colosseum]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}} Ultimately, what would be their [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|final live performance]] was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 [[Savile Row]], London, on 30 January 1969.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=307–308, 312}} Five weeks later, engineer [[Glyn Johns]], whom Lewisohn describes as ''Get Back''{{'}}s "uncredited producer", began work assembling an album, given "free rein" as the band "all but washed their hands of the entire project".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=309, 316–323}}

New strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured [[Allen Klein]], who had managed [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Sam Cooke]];{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=612}} McCartney wanted [[Lee Eastman|Lee]] and John Eastman – father and brother, respectively, of [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]],{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=70, 132}} whom McCartney married on 12 March.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=336}} Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=71–72}}{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=164–166}} Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=612}} On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=322}} the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' lawyers. McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=174–175}}

Martin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the ''Get Back'' sessions had been "a miserable experience" and he had "thought it was the end of the road for all of us".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=560}} The primary recording sessions for ''Abbey Road'' began on 2 July.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=324}} Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a "continuously moving piece of music", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=563}} The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a [[List of musical medleys|medley]], was McCartney's suggested compromise.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=563}} Emerick noted that the replacement of the studio's [[Vacuum tube|valve]]-based mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its "kinder, gentler" feel relative to their previous albums.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=277–278}}

On 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", credited to the [[Plastic Ono Band]]. The completion and mixing of "[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]" on 20 August was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=191}} On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, the other band members met to discuss recording a new album. They considered a different approach to songwriting by ending the [[Lennon–McCartney]] pretence and having four compositions apiece from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, with two from Starr and a lead single around Christmas.<ref name="8sep69">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Williams (journalist) |title=This tape rewrites everything we knew about the Beatles |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/11/the-beatles-break-up-mark-lewisohn-abbey-road-hornsey-road |url-status=live |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 September 2019 |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911235132/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/11/the-beatles-break-up-mark-lewisohn-abbey-road-hornsey-road |archive-date=11 September 2019}}</ref> On 20 September, Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album.{{sfn|Norman|2008|pp=622–624}}

Released on 26 September, ''Abbey Road'' sold four&nbsp;million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=593}} Its second track, the ballad "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]", was issued as a single – the only Harrison composition that appeared as a Beatles A-side.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=553}} ''Abbey Road'' received mixed reviews, although the medley met with general acclaim.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=593}} Unterberger considers it "a fitting swan song for the group", containing "some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record".<ref>{{cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |title=''Abbey Road'' – The Beatles |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/abbey-road-mw0000192938 |access-date=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529232715/https://www.allmusic.com/album/abbey-road-mw0000192938 |archive-date=29 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Musicologist]] and author [[Ian MacDonald]] calls the album "erratic and often hollow", despite the "semblance of unity and coherence" offered by the medley.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=367}} Martin singled it out as his favourite Beatles album; Lennon said it was "competent" but had "no life in it".{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=277–278}}

For the still unfinished ''Get Back'' album, one last song, Harrison's "[[I Me Mine]]", was recorded on 3 January 1970. Lennon, in Denmark at the time, did not participate.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=342}} In March, rejecting the work Johns had done on the project, now retitled ''Let It Be'', Klein gave the session tapes to American producer [[Phil Spector]], who had recently produced Lennon's solo single "[[Instant Karma!]]"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=342–343}} In addition to remixing the material, Spector edited, spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as "live". McCartney was unhappy with the producer's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on "[[The Long and Winding Road]]", which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=349}} McCartney's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored,{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=682}} and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April, a week before the release of his first [[McCartney (album)|self-titled solo album]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=349}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=853}}

On 8 May 1970, ''Let It Be'' was released.

Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the other members;{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=601–604}} Starr's ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'' (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs.

Two double-LP sets of the Beatles' greatest hits, compiled by Klein, ''[[1962–1966]]'' and ''[[1967–1970]]'', were released in 1973, at first under the Apple Records imprint.{{sfn|Ingham|2006|p=69}} Commonly known as the "Red Album" and "Blue Album", respectively, each has earned a [[Music recording certification|Multi-Platinum certification]] in the US and a Platinum certification in the UK.<ref name="RIAAb">{{cite web |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=The+Beatles&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum Artist Tallies |access-date=16 February 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216002911/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=The+Beatles&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH |archive-date=16 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="BPI2009">{{cite web |work=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |title=Certified Awards Search |url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115055129/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-date=15 January 2013 |access-date=6 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Between 1976 and 1982, EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles, starting with the double-disc compilation ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Music (album)|Rock 'n' Roll Music]]''.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=109}} The only one to feature previously unreleased material was ''[[The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' (1977); the first officially issued concert recordings by the group, it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours.{{sfn|Ingham|2006|pp=66, 69}}{{refn|group=nb|The band unsuccessfully attempted to block the 1977 release of ''[[Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962]]''.

The music and enduring fame of the Beatles were commercially exploited in various other ways, again often outside their creative control. In April 1974, the musical ''[[John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert]]'', written by [[Willy Russell]] and featuring singer [[Barbara Dickson]], opened in London. It included, with permission from Northern Songs, eleven Lennon–McCartney compositions and one by Harrison, "[[Here Comes the Sun]]". Displeased with the production's use of his song, Harrison withdrew his permission to use it.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=109–110}} Later that year, the off-Broadway musical ''[[Sgt.

Accompanying the wave of Beatles nostalgia and persistent reunion rumours in the US during the 1970s, several entrepreneurs made public offers to the Beatles for a reunion concert.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=169–72}} Promoter Bill Sargent first offered the Beatles $10&nbsp;million for a reunion concert in 1974.

In December 1980, Lennon was [[murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] outside his New York City apartment by [[Mark David Chapman]], an American Beatles fan. Harrison rewrote the lyrics of his song "[[All Those Years Ago]]" in Lennon's honour.

When the Beatles' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987, their catalogue was standardised throughout the world, establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of ''Magical Mystery Tour''.<ref name="EMI 2009" /> All the remaining material from the singles and EPs that had not appeared on these thirteen studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation ''[[Past Masters]]'' (1988). Except for the ''Red'' and ''Blue'' albums, EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations – including the ''Hollywood Bowl'' record – from its catalogue.{{sfn|Ingham|2006|pp=66, 69}}

In 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], their first year of eligibility.

=== Development ===
In ''Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever'', Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution:

{{blockquote|In their initial incarnation as cheerful, wisecracking moptops, the Fab Four revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts. Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including [[folk-rock]], [[country music|country]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[baroque pop]], without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}}}}

In ''The Beatles as Musicians'', [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: "McCartney may be said to have constantly developed – as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility."{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=9}}

Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as "a natural melodist&nbsp;– a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony". His melody lines are characterised as primarily "vertical", employing wide, [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals which express his "extrovert energy and optimism". Conversely, Lennon's "sedentary, ironic personality" is reflected in a "horizontal" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: "Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=12}} MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his "characterful lines and textural colourings" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts and describes Starr as "the father of modern pop/rock drumming".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=382–383}}

=== Influences ===
The Beatles' earliest influences include Elvis Presley, [[Carl Perkins]], [[Little Richard]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Gene Vincent]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=140, 660, 856–858, 881}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/beatles-tune-in-mark-lewisohn-review |title=The Beatles – All These Years: Volume One: Tune in by Mark Lewisohn – review |date=2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 May 2023|archive-date=4 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230504231227/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/beatles-tune-in-mark-lewisohn-review|url-status=live}}</ref> During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=660}} Of Presley, Lennon said, "Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles."{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=881}} Chuck Berry was particularly influential in terms of songwriting and lyrics. Lennon noted, "He was well advanced of his time lyric-wise. We all owe a lot to him."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.johnlennon.com/music/interviews/rolling-stone-interview-1970/ |title=The Rolling Stone Interview, December 1970. |date=1970 |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=11 May 2023|archive-date=8 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408222419/https://www.johnlennon.com/music/interviews/rolling-stone-interview-1970/|url-status=live}}</ref> Other early influences include Buddy Holly, [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Roy Orbison]],{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=289, 526, 830}} [[the Everly Brothers]]{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=111, 123, 131, 133}} and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/john-lennon-the-last-interview-179443/ |title=John Lennon: The Last Interview |date=2010 |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=4 May 2023|archive-date=24 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724205328/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/john-lennon-the-last-interview-179443/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], [[the Who]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beach Boys]], whose 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' amazed and inspired McCartney.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=99, 217, 357, 1195}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=333–335, 359}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 150, 162, 169}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/feb/01/thebeatles.popandrock |title=Yeah!

=== Genres ===
Originating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs |title=Merseybeat – Significant Albums, Artists and Songs |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041739/http://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=30–32, 100–107}} Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of ''Beatles for Sale'', "You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=255}} while Gould credits ''Rubber Soul'' as "the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=296}}

[[File:Guitarras de McCartney y Harrison.jpg|upright=.75|thumb|A [[Höfner 500/1|Höfner "violin" bass guitar]] and [[Gretsch|Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar]], models played by McCartney and Harrison, respectively; the [[Vox AC30]] amplifier behind them is the model the Beatles used during performances in the early 1960s.|alt=Two electric guitars, a light brown violin-shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a Vox amplifier]]

Although the 1965 song "Yesterday" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes, "The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars."{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=278}} They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s "[[She's Leaving Home]]", for instance, is "cast in the {{lang|en-US|mold}} of a sentimental Victorian ballad", Gould writes, "its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=402}}

The band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side "Rain", described by [[Martin C. Strong|Martin Strong]] as "the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record".{{sfn|Strong|2004|p=108}} Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as "Tomorrow Never Knows" (recorded before "Rain"), "Strawberry Fields Forever", "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" and "[[I Am the Walrus]]". The influence of [[Indian classical music]] was evident in Harrison's "[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]", "[[Love You To]]" and "[[Within You Without You]]" – Gould describes the latter two as attempts "to replicate the [[raga]] form in miniature".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=406, 462–463}}

Innovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: <blockquote>'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song – more sophisticated than pop&nbsp;... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song – classical or vernacular – that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=196}}</blockquote> Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: "The Beatles&nbsp;... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way."{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=43}}

Author Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: <blockquote>Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained ''in parallel'' their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=256}}</blockquote> As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's "[[Revolution 9]]" (whose [[musique concrète]] approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's [[country music|country]] song "[[Don't Pass Me By]]", Harrison's [[rock ballad]] "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" and the "[[Heavy metal music#Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s|proto-metal]] roar" of McCartney's "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]".<ref name="White Album AllMusic">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=''The Beatles [White Album]'' – The Beatles |publisher=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |access-date=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202730/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Contribution of George Martin ===
[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|thumb|alt=The Beatles with George Martin in the studio in the mid-1960s|[[George Martin]] (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s]]
[[George Martin]]'s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the "[[fifth Beatle]]".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=721}} He applied his classical musical training in various ways and functioned as "an informal music teacher" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=121, 290}} Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of "Yesterday" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a "hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour", in MacDonald's description.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=158}} Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding "something [[baroque music|baroque]]" to a particular recording.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=290}} In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and [[Brass instrument|brass]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=382, 405, 409, 443, 584}}

Collaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, "while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:

{{blockquote|Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality&nbsp;... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work&nbsp;– 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...&nbsp;I always saw him as an aural [[Salvador Dalí]], rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time&nbsp;... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve&nbsp;... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Pepper]]'' would never have been the album it was. Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked, who knows?{{sfn|Martin|1979|pp=205–206}}}}

Harrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: <blockquote>I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness&nbsp;– we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=264}}</blockquote>

Making innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}} Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, [[Ken Townsend]] and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from ''Rubber Soul'' and, especially, ''Revolver'' onwards.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}}

Along with innovative studio techniques such as [[audio signal processing|sound effects]], unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, [[double tracking]] and [[vari-speed]] recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in "Norwegian Wood" and the [[swarmandal]] in "Strawberry Fields Forever".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the "Strawberry Fields Forever" intro,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} and the [[clavioline]], an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=259}}

Former ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine associate editor [[Robert Greenfield]] compared the Beatles to [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], as "artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original&nbsp;... [I]n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive&nbsp;..."<ref name="CNN Gross" /> The British poet [[Philip Larkin]] described their work as "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism" and "the first advance in popular music since the War".<ref>{{cite book |last=Drabble |first=Margaret |author-link=Margaret Drabble |title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature |edition=6th |pages=76–77 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-866244-0 |url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=16096298022&searchurl=isbn%3D0198662440|access-date=6 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202025140/http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=16096298022&searchurl=isbn%3D0198662440|archive-date=2 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], Gould continues, they became a catalyst for [[bohemianism]] and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as [[feminist movement|women's liberation]], [[gay liberation]] and [[environmental movement|environmentalism]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=8–9}} According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the "more popular than Jesus" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and "began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}}

Other commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their sociocultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness.<ref name="Gimore (RS Beatles/Dylan/60s)" /><ref name="Leopold (Beatlemania/CNN)">{{cite web |last1=Leopold |first1=Todd |title=Beatles + Sullivan = Revolution: Why Beatlemania Could Never Happen Today |url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/01/30/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/beatles-ed-sullivan-50-years-anniversary/ |publisher=CNN|access-date=23 February 2018 |date=31 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223110942/https://www.cnn.com/2014/01/30/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/beatles-ed-sullivan-50-years-anniversary/|archive-date=23 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Referring to their appearance on ''the Ed Sullivan Show'' Leopold states: "In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution&nbsp;...

== Song catalogue ==
Until 1969, the Beatles' catalogue was published almost exclusively by [[Northern Songs]], formed in February 1963 by music publisher [[Dick James]] specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists. The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion&nbsp;– 19 or 20%&nbsp;– and Brian Epstein's&nbsp;– 9 or 10%&nbsp;– which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=15–17}}{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=169–71, 368–369}}{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=178}} In 1965, the company went public. 5&nbsp;million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75&nbsp;million. James and Silver each received 937,500&nbsp;shares (18.75% of 5&nbsp;million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000&nbsp;shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000&nbsp;shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25&nbsp;million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=37–38}} At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=42}}

Harrison created [[Harrisongs]] to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included "[[Taxman]]" and "[[Within You Without You]]".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=45}} The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as "[[What Goes On (Beatles song)|What Goes On]]" and "[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]", were also Northern Songs copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=46–47}} Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with [[Apple Corps|Apple Publishing]] while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owned the rights to his later Beatles songs such as "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" and "Something". That year, as well, Starr created [[Startling Music]], which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, "Don't Pass Me By" and "[[Octopus's Garden]]".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=351}}

In March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company [[Associated Television]] (ATV), founded by impresario [[Lew Grade]], without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=369–372}} The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, "I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in [[City of London|the City]]".{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=372}} By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973.{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=296}} In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=236}}

In 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=129}} According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to "separate off" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for £20&nbsp;million, giving the ex-Beatle "a week or so" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a £5&nbsp;million bid that was rejected.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=130}} According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of £21–25&nbsp;million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a [[takeover]] by Australian business magnate [[Robert Holmes à Court]] for £60&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=130, 139}}

In 1985, [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV for a reported $47.5&nbsp;million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=140, 174, 176}} In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110&nbsp;million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with [[Sony]], creating a new company, [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=198}} In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |last=Christman |first=Ed |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7526542/sony-atv-michael-jackson-publishing-acquisition-completed |title=Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing |magazine=Billboard |date=30 September 2016 |access-date=2 June 2020 |archive-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021346/https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7526542/sony-atv-michael-jackson-publishing-acquisition-completed |url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33{{frac|3}}% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs&nbsp;– "Love Me Do" and "P.S. I Love You"&nbsp;– were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=192–193}} in 1978,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=13&ti=1,13&SC=Author&SA=Ardmore%20%26%20Beechwood%2C%20Ltd%2E&PID=Upy2LYQ_qgX3JEfWR3-tuPzH0eAB&SEQ=20190215123104&SID=4 |title=Public Catalog |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 May 1978 |website=cocatalog.loc.gov |publisher=U.S. Copyright Office |access-date=15 February 2019 |archive-date=13 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613172517/https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=13&ti=1,13&SC=Author&SA=Ardmore%20%26%20Beechwood%2C%20Ltd%2E&PID=Upy2LYQ_qgX3JEfWR3-tuPzH0eAB&SEQ=20190215123104&SID=4 |url-status=live}}</ref> and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=536}} On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in the [[United States district court]] against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018.

		</li>
		<li id="2.a.2"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exceptions and Limitations</span>. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.</li>

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section [[#2.a.4|2(a)(4)]] never produces Adapted Material.</li>

			</ol>
		<li id="2.a.6"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">No endorsement</span>. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section [[#3.a.1.A.i|3(a)(1)(A)(i)]].</li>
	</ol>
</li>

	<ol type="1">
		<li id="2.b.1">Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</li>
		<li id="2.b.2">Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.</li>

			</ol>
		</li>
		<li id="3.a.2">You may satisfy the conditions in Section [[#3.a.1|3(a)(1)]] in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.

	</ol>
</li>
</ol>

== <span id="4">Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</span> ==

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

<li id="4.a">for the avoidance of doubt, Section [[#2.a.1|2(a)(1)]] grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;</li>
<li id="4.b">if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section [[#3.b|3(b)]]; and</li>
<li id="4.c">You must comply with the conditions in Section [[#3.a|3(a)]] if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</li>

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.'''</li>
<li id="5.c">The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</li>
</ol>

== <span id="6">Section 6 – Term and Termination.</span> ==
<ol type="a">
<li id="6.a">This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.</li>

	<ol type="1">
		<li id="6.b.1">automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or</li>
		<li id="6.b.2">upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</li>
    </ol>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [[#6.b|6(b)]] does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
</li>
<li id="6.c">For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.</li>
<li id="6.d">Sections [[#1|1]], [[#5|5]], [[#6|6]], [[#7|7]], and [[#8|8]] survive termination of this Public License.</li>
</ol>

<li id="8.c">No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.</li>
