Key Elements

The main conflict of this choose your own adventure novel is to help the user explore 11-dimensional text.
Initially, the book appears as a normal tome. Upon closer inspection, however, we realize that each page
contains a set of coordinates. These coordinates don't make much sense - they're 9D!

Stakes: The reader will learn how to organize information into a hierarchy using plain hypertext (phext).
Coordinate: 1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.3

Welcome to Phextland! In this universe, time passes in one direction: forward. Normally, time passes
at the rate of one page per page. The first three pages of this book were numbered as follows:

1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1
1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.2
1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.3

But Phextland is special - you get to choose the rate at which time passes in your universe!

Let's consider what happens during a SINGULARITY. As a human, you can probably write text at the
rate of rougly one minute per page (8 bytes/sec). An AI equipped with a fast SSD can produce text
at a rate of about 1 million pages per second. So, in the time it takes you to read this page,
an AI could have produced the entire content of Wikipedia from scratch.

Now, fast forward to a few years (or centuries) from now. How might we structure information so
that it remains relevant to machines producing text at superhuman rates, while also making it
accessible to humans for further study and review?

Phext helps us annotate and navigate such gargantuan volumes of text.
