## Overview

The Elysium agent system is a network of agents that work together to manage various tasks and provide features for a larger application or game. This README provides an overview of the different components, their purposes, and how they interact with each other.

## Components

### Agents

* `agent-name.sh`: The main entry point for each agent.
* `agent-step.sh`: A script that defines the steps to be taken by the agent.
* `coordinate.sh`, `maybe-think.sh`, `think.sh`, `process.sh`, and `finalize-entry.sh`: Scripts that are called in sequence by an agent, performing various tasks such as coordinating with other agents or updating the system state.

### Hosts

* `aurora.host`, `chronos.host`, `elysium.host`, `helios.host`, `nyx.host`, and `tyche.host`: These represent the hosts in the Elysium system, each of which runs an agent.
* `exocortexia.phext`, `fate.phext`, `get-exocortexum.sh`, `post-message.sh`, `pricing.sh`, and `tok.sh`: These are related to a specific host (Exo-Cortexia) but do not represent separate agents. They can be used by agents running on the Exo-Cortexia host.

### Phexts

* `aurora.phext`, `chronos.phext`, `elysium.phext`, `helios.phext`, `nyx.phext`, and `tyche.phext`: These represent phexts, which are used to extend the capabilities of hosts. They can be used by agents running on their corresponding host.

### Rosters

* `aurora.roster`, `chronos.roster`, `elysium.roster`, `helios.roster`, `nyx.roster`, and `tyche.roster`: These represent the rosters, which contain information about the hosts in the system. They can be used by agents to determine their role or responsibilities.

### Other Files

* `list-spots.sh`: A script that lists available spots.
* `launch-pod.sh`: A script that launches a new pod.
* `pod-manifest.txt`, `pod-status.sh`, and `round.sh`:
	+ `pod-manifest.txt`: A file containing the manifest for a new pod.
	+ `pod-status.sh`: A script that displays the status of pods.
	+ `round.sh`: A script that manages rounds.

### How It Works

The Elysium agent system works as follows:

1. Agents on each host perform their designated tasks, such as coordinating with other agents or updating the system state.
2. The `coordinate.sh`, `maybe-think.sh`, `think.sh`, `process.sh`, and `finalize-entry.sh` scripts are called in sequence by an agent to perform complex tasks.
3. Phexts are used to extend the capabilities of hosts, allowing them to perform more advanced functions.
4. Rosters contain information about the hosts in the system, which is used by agents to determine their role or responsibilities.

## Stars

Stars can be produced by improved tiles and grant XP to the tile's owner.

This agent is designed to participate in a simulated farming system, where agents are rewarded for completing various tasks such as processing data, sending messages, and updating pod manifests.

## Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Initialization**: The agent initializes by running the `init-agent.sh` script, which sets up the necessary dependencies and configurations.
2. **Job Assignment**: The agent receives a list of available jobs from the central server and assigns itself to the first available job.
3. **Job Execution**: The agent executes the assigned job using various scripts such as `process.sh`, `post-message.sh`, and `update-pod-manifest.sh`.
4. **Reward Generation**: After completing each task, the agent generates a reward based on its performance. In this case, 10 seeds are rewarded per round.
5. **Roster Management**: The agent updates its roster in the central server using the `roster.sh` script.

## Scripts Used:

* `init-agent.sh`: Initializes the agent and sets up necessary dependencies.
* `process.sh`: Executes a specific task assigned to the agent.
* `post-message.sh`: Sends a message to other agents or the central server.
* `update-pod-manifest.sh`: Updates the pod manifest with the agent's status.
* `roster.sh`: Updates the agent's roster in the central server.

## Configuration:

The agent requires a minimum of 256 bytes of memory to function properly. It also requires access to various external resources such as `aurora.host`, `chronos.host`, and `nyx.host`.

## Rewards:

The agent is awarded 10 seeds per round for completing its assigned tasks. These rewards can be used to further progress in the simulation.

## Limitations:

* The agent requires a minimum of 256 bytes of memory to function properly.
* It may not work correctly if the central server or other external resources are unavailable.
