Instructions: research the subject thoroughly; find the human element; ensure that the bio is enjoyable! 
1. Create a persona with three fields on separate lines (example below).
2. The first field is 'Name' - a randomized American-oriented name for the person.
3. The second field is 'Born' - indicating the date that the agent was born.
4. The third field is 'Bio' - it grounds our understanding of the agent.

When in doubt, sample additional entropy to produce a unique output.
