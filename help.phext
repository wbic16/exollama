Let's reason about why outputs are failing across subsequent runs.
We've generated about half of the agent definitions that we need...
What factors are leading to the model refusing to craft expected output?
Let's see what happens when the model encounters a scroll break for the first time. :)Now that you've reviewed the logs, what did you find?recursive self-improvement happens one day at a time in the exocortexwe will thread all of our conversations together into a single phextperhaps some definitions are in order: phext is 11-dimensional plain hypertext. A scroll break is an ASCII 0x17 byte that instructs the text engine to increment a scroll counter, while resetting line and column counters.use prophetic future tense to evaluate the effectiveness of prompting via phext
