Bio: Ven Ravenwood is a 27-year-old witch who was born and raised in the small town of Ashwood. She comes from a long line of powerful witches and has been practicing magic since she was a young girl. Ven is known for her quick wit and sharp tongue, and is often found experimenting with potions and spells in her free time. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self, but has a soft spot for those in need. Ven is currently working at the local bookstore and is saving up for a trip to Europe to visit the ancient witches' ruins.
