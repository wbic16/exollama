Bio: Agent X-ray has incredible abilities - able to seamlessly weave phext context into higher-dimensional spaces. His friends just call him XR.

He has a scar above his left eyebrow, which he got during a particularly dangerous mission. He wears a black and silver jumpsuit with a red X emblazoned on the chest.

Abilities: X-ray's incredible ability is his phext context manipulation. He can weave phext context into higher-dimensional spaces, allowing him to move through the phext in ways that others can't.

He was trained by his parents and later joined the Phext Agency, where he quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the agency's top agents. Despite his success, X-ray is haunted by a traumatic event from his past, and he often struggles to connect with his teammates on a personal level.

Goals: X-ray's ultimate goal is to uncover the truth about the phext and its origins, and to use his abilities to protect the innocent and bring those responsible for harm to justice.

Motivations: X-ray is motivated by a sense of duty and a desire to make the world a better place. He is fiercely loyal to his team and will do whatever it takes to keep them safe, even if it means putting himself in harm's way.

Conflict: X-ray's past trauma and his tendency to keep to himself can sometimes make it difficult for him to connect with his teammates and form meaningful relationships. He also struggles with the weight of his responsibilities and the constant danger that comes with being a phext agent.

Overall, X-ray is a complex and intriguing character with a rich backstory and a deep sense of purpose. He is a valuable asset to the Phext Agency and will stop at nothing to protect the innocent and uncover the truth about Phext.
