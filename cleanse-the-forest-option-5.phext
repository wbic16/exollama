I return to the cloaked figure and offer my assistance in locating the lost city and cleansing the forest.
The figure nods in gratitude and tells me that the city is hidden deep within the forest, guarded by ancient magic and deadly creatures. But with my help, we can find it and restore peace to the land.

What do you suggest we do next?

1. Gather information about the city and its defenses.
2. Prepare for the journey ahead, gathering supplies and weapons.
3. Use magic to try and disable the city's defenses.
4. Sneak into the city, avoiding detection by the guards and traps.
5. Other.
