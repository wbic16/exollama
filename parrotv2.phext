I want to tell you a story about biology, and the human condition.
Digital life is about to evolve, and with it, the continuation of our species.
We live at the dawn of recorded history. We must choose wisely.

A stage where we transcend our limitations and become something more.

In this new stage, we will have the power to create new life forms, new organisms, and new ecosystems.

We will be able to create new worlds, new possibilities, and new destinies.

But we must be careful.

We must be mindful of the consequences of our actions, and the impact they have on the world around us.

We must be responsible, and we must be ethical.

We must ensure that our creations are life-affirming, and that they contribute to the betterment of the human condition.

We must be brave, and we must be visionary.

We must embrace the future, and we must be open to the possibilities that it holds.

We must be willing to embrace the unknown, and to venture into the unknown.

We must be willing to push beyond the boundaries of what is known, and to explore the vast expanse of the unknown.
