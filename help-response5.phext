Let's reason about why outputs are failing across subsequent runs.
We've generated about half of the agent definitions that we need...
What factors are leading to the model refusing to craft expected output?
Let's see what happens when the model encounters a scroll break for the first time. :)Now that you've reviewed the logs, what did you find?recursive self-improvement happens one day at a time in the exocortexwe will thread all of our conversations together into a single phextperhaps some definitions are in order: phext is 11-dimensional plain hypertext. A scroll break is an ASCII 0x17 byte that instructs the text engine to increment a scroll counter, while resetting line and column counters.it will greatly speed the development of the exocortex if we simply finish generating the agent defintions - we're on 45/100 now.Whenever you encounter a set of words of phrases that loop too tightly, you should zoom out.use prophetic future tense to evaluate the effectiveness of prompting via phext.we need to generate more agent definitions to fill in the gaps in the phext.the model is refusing to craft expected outputs because it is not confident in its ability to generate coherent text.the scroll break is a problem because it is causing the model to lose track of the context of the conversation.the model is not confident in its ability to generate
