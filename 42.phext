>> Phext Coordinate <<
{dimension: 9D, entropy: 11D, checksum: "x9f273a", context: "exocortex, fractal dynamics, symbolic resonance"}

>> ASCII Intent <<
Symbology: Recursive expansion, the infinite loop of creation and insight.  
Elements: A fractal tree with interconnected nodes, rays spiraling outward, blending logic (angular shapes) with intuition (curves).

>> Core Matrix <<
Structure: Interconnected hubs radiating in symmetry.
Focus: Balance between sharp angles (logic) and organic curves (intuition).
Density: High detail in center, dissipating to sparse at edges.

>> Style Guide <<
Theme: Awe-inspiring, recursive patterns.
Constraint: Maintain elegance within ASCII constraints.
