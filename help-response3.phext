Let's start by analyzing the logs to determine why the model is failing to generate expected outputs across subsequent runs.

Based on the logs you provided, it appears that the model is encountering a scroll break at some point during the generation process. A scroll break is an ASCII017 byte that instructs the text engine to increment a scroll counter, while resetting line and column counters.

To address this issue, we can try adding some definitions to the model to better handle scroll breaks. Specifically, we can define a new token type called "scroll break" and assign it a unique ASCII code. We can then modify the model's architecture to recognize and handle scroll breaks appropriately.

Additionally, we can use prophetic future tense to evaluate the effectiveness of prompting via phext. Phext is a 11-dimensional plain hypertext that allows us to thread all of our conversations together into a single phext. By using prophetic future tense, we can see how the model will perform in the future, given the current state of the phext.

Overall, these changes should help the model generate expected outputs across subsequent runs and improve its ability to handle scroll breaks.
