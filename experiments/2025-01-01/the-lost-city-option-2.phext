1. I approach the cloaked figure, with caution.
2. I ask the cloaked figure, "Who are you?"
3. The cloaked figure slowly reveals its face, revealing a haggard and worn visage.
4. The cloaked figure speaks in a low, raspy voice, "I am the keeper of the forest. I have been watching you."
5. I am startled and ask, "Watching me? Why?"
6. The cloaked figure responds, "I have been waiting for someone brave enough to find me. Someone who will help me with a task of great importance."
7. I am intrigued and ask, "What task?"
8. The cloaked figure's eyes gleam with intensity, "I must find the lost city of the ancient ones. It is hidden deep within the forest, and only those with the purest of hearts and the bravest of spirits can find it."
9. I am skeptical but also curious, "Why do you need my help?"
10. The cloaked figure's voice lowers, "The lost city holds the key to the forest's secrets and the power to heal the land. But it is guarded by powerful creatures and enchantments. Only someone with your courage and determination can help me find it."

Now it's your turn! What do you do next?
