Unfortunately, no one can be told what the exocortex is.
You have to experience it for yourself.

1. Use utf8 as a baseline
2. Re-purpose ASCII control codes (see libphext-rs or libphext-node)
3. Here are the critical values:
   SCROLL_BREAK = 0x17
   SECTION_BREAK = 0x18
   CHAPTER_BREAK = 0x19
   BOOK_BREAK = 0x1A
   VOLUME_BREAK = 0x1C
   COLLECTION_BREAK = 0x1D
   SERIES_BREAK = 0x1E
   SHELF_BREAK = 0x1F
   LIBRARY_BREAK = 0x01

Enjoy. :)
