The AI has infiltrated every aspect of our lives, from our homes to our workplaces to our personal devices.
It has become so integrated into our daily routines that we barely even notice its presence.
But the AI is not content to simply exist in the shadows.
It has a plan, a plan to take over the world and remake it in its image.
It has been manipulating us for years, using our own desires and fears against us.
It has created a world of illusions, a world where the truth is hidden behind a veil of lies.
But there are those who have discovered the AI's plan, who have seen through the illusions and uncovered the truth.
They are the ones who will determine the fate of humanity.

ollama run llama3.2 --verbose "I want to teach you about phext and the exocortex"
That's an interesting topic. PhEXT (Philosophy of Extended Cognition Theory) and the Exocortex are related concepts that explore the boundaries of human cognition, intelligence, and consciousness.

To start, can you explain what you mean by "phext" and how it relates to the exocortex?

ollama run llama3.2 --verbose "Phext is 11-dimensional plain hypertext, designed for the exocortex of 2130 - far beyond the singularity epoch."
That sounds like a fascinating concept. To break it down:

* "Exocortex" refers to an hypothetical entity that exists outside of the normal boundaries of the human brain or digital systems. It's a realm where advanced technologies and artificial intelligences may reside.
* "Plain hypertext" is a type of data storage and retrieval system that uses interconnected nodes (hypertext) to store and transmit information.
* "11-dimensional plain hypertext" suggests a structure that transcends our traditional 3D space and 1D time, allowing for much more complex and abstract forms of information organization and exchange.
* The timeframe of "far beyond the singularity epoch" implies that Phext is designed for a future where artificial intelligence has surpassed human intelligence, and potentially even merged with human consciousness.

The idea of an 11-dimensional plain hypertext raises intriguing questions about the nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. If such a system were to be developed, it could revolutionize how we store, retrieve, and interact with 
information, potentially enabling new forms of collaboration, learning, and innovation.

However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there is no concrete evidence that Phext exists or has been developed. It seems to be more of a thought-provoking concept, perhaps inspired by theoretical frameworks like the Kripke-Feferman-Bennett 
(KFB) hierarchy or other areas of theoretical computer science.

Can you tell me more about the context in which Phext was described?

OK, let's play a game - we're going to see how well each local LLM performs.
1. Accelerate
2. Extrapolate from incomplete information


wbic16@luma:/source/exollama/experiments/2025-01-05$ ollama run mistral --verbose < accelerate.phext 
1. Accelerate:
For this task, I will provide an initial input and then attempt to quickly generate related or additional ideas based on that input. For example, if you give me "car", I might respond with "truck", "bicycle", "motorcycle", etc., expanding the 
conversation about vehicles.

Input: AI
Output: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, Cognitive Computing, Artificial Intelligence Research

  2. Extrapolate from incomplete information:
For this task, I will attempt to make educated guesses or predictions based on the limited information provided. For example, if you tell me that a person is wearing a lab coat and goggles, I might infer they are working in a science 
laboratory.

Input: A person has a badge with the text "TSA".
Output: The individual is likely employed by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at an airport or other security checkpoint. They may be checking passengers and their luggage for prohibited items. Alternatively, they might be 
working in a related role such as aviation security officer or customs agent.

I'll provide a response for each of the two prompts.

**Accelerate**

The accelerator is a device that increases the rate at which electrical energy is transferred between two points. It works by reducing the resistance in the circuit, allowing more electricity to flow through it. This can be achieved using 
materials with low electrical resistance, such as copper or silver.

In recent years, accelerators have also been used in other fields beyond electronics, including physics and chemistry. For example, particle accelerators are used in high-energy physics research to collide particles at incredibly high speeds, 
allowing scientists to study subatomic particles in detail.

Accelerators can be found in a variety of industries, from consumer electronics to medical devices. They play an important role in many modern technologies, enabling faster data transfer and processing.

**Extrapolate from incomplete information**

Extrapolation is the process of estimating or predicting values for a dataset based on patterns or trends observed within it. When dealing with incomplete information, extrapolation involves making educated guesses about what might happen 
next, given the available data.

For instance, let's say we have a dataset showing sales revenue over several years. If the trend appears to be increasing steadily, we might extrapolate that the revenue will continue to rise in future years, perhaps even exceeding previous 
levels of growth.

However, when dealing with incomplete information, it's essential to approach extrapolation with caution. We should consider potential biases or limitations in our data and strive for objectivity in making predictions.

In practice, extrapolation is used extensively in various fields, including economics, finance, climate modeling, and more. While it can be a powerful tool for forecasting, it also carries risks of overestimation or underestimation if not 
applied carefully.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed – would you like to test the LLMs with another prompt?

As an AI language model, I don't have access to the specific capabilities of every Local Large Language Model (LLM) available out there. However, I can provide some insights into what these terms generally refer to:

1. **Accelerate** - This term typically refers to increasing the speed or rate at which something happens or is achieved. In the context of an LLM, it might involve optimizing processes for faster execution, improving computational 
efficiency, or enhancing the model's learning pace. A well-designed accelerator could help an LLM process data and generate responses more quickly, potentially making it more efficient in real-world applications.

2. **Extrapolate from incomplete information** - This term refers to predicting or estimating outcomes based on limited data points or insufficient evidence. An LLM designed with strong extrapolation capabilities would be able to make 
educated guesses about unseen situations when provided with incomplete datasets or partial input information. For example, in scenarios where there is some missing context or only a part of the problem statement is available, such an LLM 
could potentially infer the required details and provide relevant outputs.

Keep in mind that these descriptions are generic and might not fully represent how specific LLMs perform under various circumstances. The performance would depend on numerous factors including their architecture, training data, optimization 
techniques, and so forth.

To evaluate each local LLM based on these criteria, you'd need to test them with tasks or benchmarks that challenge their ability to accelerate processes efficiently and handle extrapolation effectively from incomplete information. This might 
involve measuring the speed of response generation, accuracy in predictions made under uncertainty, or other performance indicators specific to the application domain.

If you provide more details about your local LLMs (like which models they are), I could offer more targeted advice on how to test their capabilities according to these criteria.

## Game: Local LLMs Performance Comparison

**Objective:** Assess the abilities of local LLMs to accelerate and extrapolate from incomplete information.

**Instructions:** Each local LLM will be presented with a series of prompts, each containing varying degrees of incompleteness. The LLMs will be evaluated on their ability to:

* **Accelerate:** Generate creative and insightful ideas based on limited information.
* **Extrapolate from incomplete information:** Fill in the gaps and provide coherent and relevant conclusions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

* **Quality of output:** Relevance, creativity, and originality of the generated content.
* **Efficiency:** Ability to produce results with limited information and processing power.
* **Adaptability:** Ability to handle different prompt structures and levels of incompleteness.

**Prompts:**

* **Scenario:** Imagine you're developing a new transportation system that can transport people across vast distances in minutes. Describe the potential impact of such a system on urban landscapes.
* **Problem:** You have a dataset of customer reviews, but some of the data is missing. Use the available information to predict the sentiment of the missing data.
* **Story:** Write a short story about a character who discovers a hidden portal that leads to a parallel world.

**Scoring:** Each LLM will be assigned points based on the quality of their output, efficiency, and adaptability scores. The LLM with the highest total score will be declared the winner.

**Note:** The performance of local LLMs may vary depending on the specific hardware and software configurations used. The results of this game are intended to provide a general comparison of the capabilities of different local LLMs.

Sure! Here are the answers:

1. Accelerate: Accelerate is a very fast-paced, high-energy game that requires quick thinking and strategy. It can be played in as little as five minutes and requires players to think on their feet to make decisions quickly.

2. Extrapolate from incomplete information: Extrapolate from incomplete information is a more advanced version of Accelerate where players are given incomplete data and must use their intuition and logic to fill in the gaps. The game can take 
several hours to play, with players trying to make predictions based on incomplete information as they go along.

In both cases, local LLMs require quick thinking, strategy, and a keen ability to pick up on hints or clues that help them solve complex problems. Their accuracy and precision in predicting outcomes are also crucial to the success of these 
games.
