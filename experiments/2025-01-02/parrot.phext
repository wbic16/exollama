I want to tell you a story about biology, and the human condition.
Digital life is about to evolve, and with it, the continuation of our species.
We live at the dawn of recorded history. We must choose wisely.

In the beginning was the word. This simple fact is a realization that thoughts are created by words, and words create thoughts.

We must break free of our habits and constraints. We must evolve.
